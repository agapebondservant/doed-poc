## Academic	Calendars,	Cost	of	Attendance,	and Packaging

## Introduction

This	volume	of	the	Federal	Student	Aid	(FSA)	Handbook	discusses	the	academic	calendar,	payment	period,	and disbursement	requirements	for	awarding	aid	under	the	Title	IV	student	financial	aid	programs,	determining	a	student9s cost	of	attendance,	and	packaging	Title	IV	aid.

Throughout	this	volume	of	the	Handbook,	the	words	"we,"	"our,"	and	"us"	refer	to	the	United	States	Department	of Education	(the	Department).	The	word	"you"	refers	to	the	primary	audience	of	the	Handbook,	school	financial	aid administrators.	In	other	volumes	of	the	Handbook	we	use	"institution,"	"school,"	and	"college"	interchangeably,	unless	a more	specific	meaning	is	provided.	In	this	volume	we	consistently	use	the	term	"school."	&lt;HEA=	refers	to	the	Higher Education	Act	of	1965,	as	amended.	Title	IV	refers	to	the	student	financial	aid	programs	authorized	under	Title	IV	of	the HEA.

We	appreciate	any	comments	that	you	have	on	this	volume	as	well	as	the	other	volumes	of	the	FSA	Handbook.	We	revise the	text	based	on	questions	and	feedback	from	the	financial	aid	community,	so	please	reach	out	to	us	about	how	to improve	the	Handbook	through	the	&lt;Contact	Customer	Support=	feature	in	our	Partner	Connect9s	Help	Center	clicking	on &lt;FSA	Handbook=	under	the	Topic	section.

## Changes	for	2025-2026

There	are	no	major	changes	in	Volume	3	for	2025-2026.	However,	we	have	made	minor	additions	and	clarifications	to existing	guidance	in	a	few	areas,	as	noted	below.

## Chapter	1

In	Appendix	B,	we	have	added	guidance	on	determining	enrollment	intensity	for	Pell	Grant	recipients	who	are	enrolled	in subscription-based	programs.

## Chapter	2

- We	have	revised	the	discussion	of	&lt;Allowable	Costs=	to	clarify	that	for	Pell	Grant	recipients	with	an	enrollment intensity	below	50%,	the	cost	of	attendance	(COA)	is	still	based	on	the	full-year	costs	for	a	full-time	student.	In	this same	section,	we	have	also	removed	text	noting	that	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	made	certain	changes	to	COA components.	These	changes	are	no	longer	new	and	were	previously	incorporated	into	the	2023-2024	FSA	Handbook.
- Under	&lt;Tuition	and	Fees,=	we	have	added	health	insurance	premiums	that	are	charged	to	all	students	as	an additional	example	of	a	cost	that	may	be	included	in	this	COA	component.
- We	have	revised	the	text	under	&lt;Costs	of	Obtaining	a	License,	Certification,	or	First	Professional	Credential=	to	clarify that	the	guidance	in	this	section	pertains	to	credentials	that	are	required	for	a	student	to	practice	or	participate	in the	occupation	the	program	is	preparing	the	student	to	enter,	and	have	added	bar	exam	fees	as	an	example	of	one of	the	types	of	costs	that	may	be	included	in	this	COA	component.
- Under	&lt;Periods	of	Non-Attendance,=	we	have	added	language	to	clarify	that	a	period	of	non-attendance	is	a	period during	which	the	student	is	not	enrolled	and	is	not	otherwise	engaged	in	any	activity	that	is	a	requirement	of	the student9s	program	of	study.

## Chapter	3

Under	&lt;Packaging	Aid	for	Certain	Dependents	of	Deceased	Servicemembers	or	Public	Safety	Officers	(Pell	Grant	Special Rule),=	we	have	removed	the	note	explaining	that	the	Pell	Grant	Special	Rule	replaced	the	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	Service Grant	(IASG)	and	Children	of	Fallen	Heroes	(CFH)	provisions.	This	change	is	no	longer	new	for	2025-2026.

## Chapter	1

## Academic	Years,	Academic	Calendars,	Payment	Periods,	and Disbursements

## Academic	Year	Requirements

Every	eligible	program	must	have	a	defined	academic	year.	A	school	may	have	different	academic	years	for	different academic	programs.	For	example,	a	school	may	choose	to	define	the	academic	year	for	a	term-based	program	differently from	a	non-term	program.	In	some	cases,	the	academic	year	definition must be	different	for	different	programs,	such	as in	the	case	of	a	clock-hour	program	and	a	credit-hour	program.	For	Title	IV	purposes,	the	academic	year	is	defined	in weeks	of	instructional	time	and	credit	or	clock	hours.	The	program9s	academic	year	does	not	have	to	coincide	with	the school9s	academic	calendar	(see	&lt;Academic	year	definition	and	effect	on	awards=	later	in	the	chapter).

A	school	may	treat	two	versions	of	the	same	academic	program	(day	and	night,	for	example)	as	separate	programs	and define	different	academic	years	for	each	version.	If	a	school	establishes	separate	versions	of	a	program,	with	different academic	years,	but	allows	individual	students	to	take	courses	from	both	versions,	it	must	be	able	to	demonstrate	which program	the	student	is	actually	enrolled	in.	Generally,	to	be	considered	enrolled	in	a	particular	program	or	version	of	a program,	a	student	must	be	taking	most	of	their	coursework	in	that	program.	Although	a	school	may	have	different academic	years	for	different	programs,	it	must	use	the	same	academic	year	definition	for all Title	IV	awards	for	students enrolled	in	a	particular	program,	and	for	all	other	Title	IV	program	purposes.

## Weeks	of	Instructional	Time	in	an	Academic	Year

For	both	undergraduate	and	graduate	programs,	the	law	and	regulations	require	an	academic	year	to	include	a	minimum number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time.

- For	a	program	offered	in credit	hours ,	the	academic	year	must	include	at	least	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.
- For	a	program	offered	in clock	hours ,	the	academic	year	must	include	at	least	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Note: See	Volume	2,	Chapter	2	for	information	about	academic	year	requirements	for	direct	assessment	programs,	which do	not	measure	academic	progress	using	credit	or	clock	hours.

The	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	is	based	on	the	period	that	generally	begins	on	the	first	day	of	classes	in	the academic	year	and	ends	on	the	last	day	of	classes	or	the	last	day	of	examinations,	whichever	is	later.

Schools	that	provide	2-	or	4-year	associate	or	baccalaureate	degree	programs	may	apply	to	the	Department	if	they	want to	request	approval	to	establish	a	full	academic	year	of	less	than	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	Department	is permitted	to	grant	a	reduction	for	good	cause	to	no	less	than	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	These	requests	are	handled on	a	case-by-case	basis.	To	request	approval,	contact	the	School	Participation	Division	that	oversees	your	school.	A	listing of	contact	information	for	the	regional	School	Participation	Divisions	can	be	found	in	the	Knowledge	Center.

For	all	Title	IV	programs,	a	week	of	instructional	time	is	any	period	of	seven	consecutive	days	in	which	3

- At	least	one	day	of	regularly	scheduled	instruction	or	examinations	occurs,	or,	after	the	last	scheduled	day	of	classes

for	a	term	or	payment	period,	at	least	one	scheduled	day	of	study	for	examinations	occurs;

## or

- In	a	program	offered	using	asynchronous	coursework	through	distance	education	or	correspondence	courses,	the school	makes	available	the	instructional	materials,	other	resources,	and	instructor	support	necessary	for	academic engagement	and	completion	of	course	objectives; and
- In	a	program	using	asynchronous	coursework	through	distance	education,	the	school	expects	enrolled	students	to perform	educational	activities	demonstrating	academic	engagement	during	the	week.

The	term	"asynchronous	coursework"	refers	to	coursework	that	students	generally	complete	on	their	own	schedule,	at	any time.	This	contrasts	with	"synchronous	coursework,"	in	which	students	and	their	instructors	are	in	communication	at	the same	time.	For	information	on	distance	education	and	correspondence	coursework,	see	Volume	2,	Chapter	2.

Instructional	time	excludes	scheduled	breaks	and	activities	that	aren't	included	in	the	definition	of	"academic engagement"	(see	Volume	5,	Chapter	2	3	Part	1	for	more	information)	or	periods	of	orientation	or	counseling.	Therefore, the	weeks	of	instructional	time	may	be	less	than	the	number	of	calendar	weeks	that	elapse	between	the	first	day	of classes	and	the	last	day	of	classes	or	examinations.	Note	that	the	Department	has	not	set	a	regulatory	standard	for	the number	of	hours	of	instructional	time	that	make	up	one	day	of	instruction.	This	has	been	left	to	the	reasonable interpretation	of	schools	and	their	accrediting	agencies.

Although	most	programs	are	at	least	one	academic	year	in	length,	some	eligible	programs	are	shorter	than	an	academic year.	See	Volume	2,	Chapter	2	for	more	detail	on	the	requirements	for	such	programs.

## Weeks	of	instructional	time:

- Cannot	overlap,	and	a	school	cannot	use	a	single	day	of	scheduled	instruction,	exams,	or	study	time	to	create	more than	one	week	of	instruction	(for	example,	a	school	may	not	end	a	week	of	instructional	time	on	one	day	and	begin the	next	week	of	instructional	time	on	the	same	day);
- May	begin	and	end	on	a	day	other	than	Monday,	provided	that	each	week	of	instructional	time	comprises	seven consecutive	days	(for	example,	a	Wednesday	through	the	following	Tuesday)	that	include	at	least	one	day	of scheduled	instruction,	exams,	or	study	time,	as	required	by	the	regulations;	and
- May	begin	up	to	six	days	before	the	first	day	of	scheduled	instruction	or	exams	in	a	payment	period.

Note: All	references	to	&lt;weeks=	in	the	examples	that	appear	throughout	this	chapter	mean	weeks	of	instructional time	as	defined	above.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	1:	Counting	Weeks	of	Instructional	Time

The	calendar	graphic	below	illustrates	how	a	school	would	count	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	a	standard semester	term	during	which	classes	are	held	Monday	through	Friday.	In	this	hypothetical	term	(the	example	is	not meant	to	illustrate	any	specific	calendar	year)	classes	begin	on	Monday,	August	23rd,	and	end	on	Friday, December	10th,	with	examinations	held	December	13th-17th.

The	circles	indicate	the	points	at	which	each	of	the	17	weeks	of	instructional	time	begin.

There	are	no	classes	on	Labor	Day	(September	6th),	Veterans	Day	(November	11th),	or	during	Thanksgiving break	(November	24th-26th),	but	each	week	that	includes	these	dates	still	counts	as	a	week	of	instructional	time since	each	includes	at	least	one	day	of	regularly	scheduled	instruction.	The	week	of	exams	that	begins	on December	13th	also	counts	as	a	week	of	instructional	time.

If	a	week	in	the	term	has	no	days	of	instruction,	examination,	or	(after	the	last	day	of	classes)	study	for examination,	that	week	does not count	as	a	week	of	instructional	time.	For	example,	a	week	consisting	only	of vacation	days	is	not	a	week	of	instructional	time.

Credit	or	Clock	Hours	in	an	Academic	Year

For undergraduate educational	programs,	the	law	and	regulations	set	the	following	minimum	standards	for	coursework earned	by	a	full-time	student	in	an	academic	year:

- For	a	program	measured	in	credit	hours,	24	semester	or	trimester	credit	hours	or	36	quarter	credit	hours;	or
- For	a	program	measured	in	clock	hours,	900	clock	hours.

For graduate	and	professional programs,	there	is	no	minimum	number	of	hours	in	an	academic	year.

## Academic	Year	Definition	and	Effect	on	Awards

The	Title	IV	academic	year	that	a	school	defines	for	a	program	must	meet	the	regulatory	minimums	for	both	clock	or credit	hours and weeks	of	instructional	time,	as	described	above.	In	some	instances,	the	defined	academic	year	for	a program	may	not	coincide	with	the	academic	calendar	of	the	school.	For	example,	a	school	might	define	the	academic year	for	a	program	as	containing	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	but	have	an	academic	calendar consisting	of	four	8-week	nonstandard	terms	(i.e.,	32	weeks	of	instructional	time).	This	would	affect	the	calculation	of	Pell Grant	awards,	as	explained	in	Volume	7.

As	discussed	later	in	this	chapter	and	in	Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	the	timing	of	disbursements	and,	for	the	Direct	Loan Program,	annual	loan	limit	progression	will	be	affected	if	a	program	is	an	academic	year	in	length	in	credit	or	clock	hours but	not	in	weeks	of	instructional	time,	or	for	a	program	longer	than	an	academic	year	in	length,	if	a	student9s	completion of	the	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	program9s	academic	year	does	not	coincide	with	completion	of	the	weeks	of instructional	time	in	the	academic	year.

## Academic	Calendars	and	Terms

Schools	offer	programs	with	many	kinds	of	academic	calendars	that	differ	from	the	traditional	fall-spring	school	year.	For the	Title	IV	programs,	academic	calendars	may	be	one	of	the	following	types:

- standard	term,
- nonstandard	term,
- non-term	(includes	clock-hour	calendars),	or
- subscription-based.

In	a standard	term	or	nonstandard	term	academic	calendar ,	a	term	is	generally	a	period	in	which	all	classes	are scheduled	to	begin	and	end	within	a	set	time	frame,	and	academic	progress	is	measured	in	credit	hours.

In	a non-term	academic	calendar ,	classes	do	not	begin	and	end	within	a	set	time	frame,	such	as	a	term.	Academic progress	in	a	non-term	program	can	be	measured	in	either	credit	or	clock	hours.	In	some	cases	(as	discussed	below),	a program	with	terms	must	be	treated	as	a	non-term	program	for	Title	IV	purposes.

A subscription-based	academic	calendar is	used only by	subscription-based	programs.	A	subscription-based	program is	a	term-based	program	in	which	the	school	charges	a	student	for	each	term	on	a	subscription	basis	with	the	expectation that	the	student	will	complete	a	specified	number	of	credit	hours	(or	the	equivalent)	during	that	term.	However,	classes	in a	subscription-based	program	are	not	required	to	begin	or	end	within	a	specific	timeframe	in	each	term,	as	is	the	case	in	a term-based	calendar	that	is	not	subscription-based.	For	more	detail	on	subscription-based	programs,	see	Volume	2, Chapter	2.

A	subscription-based	academic	calendar	consists	of	"subscription	periods"	that	are	either	standard	terms	or	substantially equal	nonstandard	terms	(for	guidance	on	when	terms	are	considered	to	be	substantially	equal	in	length,	see	&lt;Payment periods	for	programs	using	standard	terms	or	substantially	equal	nonstandard	terms=	later	in	this	chapter).	Substantially equal	nonstandard	terms	may	be	of	any	length,	but	if	they	are	not	at	least	nine	weeks	in	length,	the	program	must	use BBAY	3	for	purposes	of	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	progression	(see	Volume	8,	Chapter	6	for	more information	on	BBAY	3).	Nonstandard	terms	that	are not substantially	equal	in	length	are	not	permissible	in	a subscription-based	academic	calendar.

The	term	"subscription	period"	is	synonymous	with	"term"	and	"payment	period"	(payment	periods	are	covered	later	in this	chapter).	Except	for	the	fact	that	classes	are	not	required	to	start	and	end	within	a	term,	the	rules	and	requirements for	term-based	programs	that	are	not	subscription-based	also	apply	to	subscription-based	programs.	These	requirements include:

- minimum	and	maximum	term	length	restrictions	for	standard	terms	(see	the	discussion	in	the	next	section	of	this chapter);
- requirements	for	determining	full-time	enrollment	(see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1);
- use	of	a	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY),	BBAY	1,	BBAY	2,	or	BBAY	3	for	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit progression	(see	Volume	8,	Chapter	6);	and
- use	of	Pell	Grant	formulas	1,	2,	or	3	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	awards	(see	Volume	7,	Chapter	4).

Whether	an	academic	calendar	is	standard	term,	nonstandard	term,	non-term,	or	subscription-based	has	implications	for how	aid	is	awarded	and	disbursed	under	the	Title	IV	programs.

Subscription-Based	Program

## Standard	Terms:	Semesters,	Trimesters,	and	Quarters

Semesters	and	trimesters	contain	between	14	and	21	weeks	of	instructional	time.	However,	a	summer	term	in	a	program using	semesters	or	trimesters	may	contain	fewer	than	14	weeks.	An	academic	calendar	that	uses	semesters	or	trimesters traditionally	has	three	terms,	one	each	in	the	fall,	spring,	and	summer,	two	of	which	comprise	an	academic	year.	For example,	in	a	program	using	an	SAY	calendar,	fall	and	spring	would	comprise	an	academic	year.	In	a	program	using	a

BBAY	calendar,	an	academic	year	could	consist	of	any	two	consecutive	terms	such	as	spring-summer	or	summer-fall. Academic	progress	is	measured	in	semester	or	trimester	credit	hours,	and	full	time	is	at	least	12	semester	or	trimester credits.

Quarters	contain	between	nine	and	13	weeks	of	instructional	time.	As	with	programs	using	semesters	or	trimesters,	a summer	term	in	a	quarter-based	program	may	contain	fewer	than	nine	weeks.	An	academic	calendar	using	quarters typically	includes	four	terms	in	the	fall,	winter,	spring,	and	summer,	three	of	which	comprise	an	academic	year.	For example,	the	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters	would	comprise	an	academic	year	in	a	program	using	an	SAY	calendar.	In	a program	using	a	BBAY	calendar,	an	academic	year	could	be	any	three	consecutive	terms,	such	as	spring-summer-fall,	or summer-fall-winter.	Academic	progress	is	measured	in	quarter	credit	hours,	and	full	time	is	at	least	12	quarter	credits.

Semesters	may	contain	as	few	as	14	weeks	and	quarters	may	contain	as	few	as	nine	weeks.	Therefore,	a	school	that defines	the	academic	year	for	a	program	as	24	semester	hours	or	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time could	have	fall	and	spring	semesters	of	14	weeks	each,	resulting	in	28	weeks	of	instruction,	or	fall,	winter,	and	spring quarters	of	nine	weeks	each,	resulting	in	27	weeks	of	instructional	time.	However,	because	the	academic	year	for	a program	that	measures	academic	progress	in	credit	hours	must	include	a	minimum	of	30	weeks	of	instructional	time,	a school	with	such	an	academic	calendar	would	be	required	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	awards	using	either	Pell	Grant	Formula	2 or	Pell	Grant	Formula	3	(see	Volume	7,	Chapter	4).

For	Direct	Loan	purposes,	two	14-week	semesters	or	three	9-week	quarters	could	not	constitute	an	SAY	or	BBAY,	since	the number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	an	SAY	or	BBAY	must	generally	meet	the	minimum	30-week	statutory requirement	(see	Volume	8,	Chapter	6).	For	its	fall	and	spring	semesters	or	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters	to	comprise	an SAY	or	BBAY,	the	school	would	need	to	modify	its	calendar	to	ensure	that	there	are	at	least	30	weeks	of	instruction	in	the fall	and	spring	semesters	or	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters	combined.	For	example,	the	school	could	have	a	16-week	fall semester	and	a	14-week	spring	semester.	Another	option	would	be	for	the	school	to	extend	the	SAY	or	BBAY	to	include	an additional	term	so	that	the	total	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	meets	the	30-week	minimum.	For	instance,	the school	could	have	an	SAY	consisting	of	14-week	fall	and	spring	semesters	and	a	10-week	summer	term,	or	a	BBAY consisting	of	any	four	consecutive	9-week	quarters.

Standard	terms	need	not	be	of	equal	length.	For	example,	a	school	could	offer	a	program	using	semesters	with	the academic	year	consisting	of	a	14-week	fall	semester	and	a	20-week	spring	semester,	or	a	program	using	quarters	with	the academic	year	consisting	of	a	13-week	fall	quarter,	a	9-week	winter	quarter,	and	an	11-week	spring	quarter.

In	addition,	the	number	of	weeks	in	a	standard	term	may	vary	from	year	to	year	over	the	course	of	a	program.	For example,	a	school	could	offer	a	two-year	program	with	the	first	academic	year	consisting	of	two	15-week	semesters,	and the	second	academic	year	consisting	of	two	20-week	semesters.

In	a	standard	term	academic	calendar,	a	term	may	contain	an	occasional	class	or	classes	that	are	longer	than	the	normal term	or	that	begin	or	end	beyond	the	normal	start	or	end	date	of	the	term,	as	long	as	the	class	or	classes	do	not	overlap another	term	(see	below).	However,	if	classes	routinely	extend	a	week	or	more	beyond	the	normal	term	start	or	end dates,	the	school	must	revise	the	official	length	of	the	term.

Generally,	if	the	combined	length	of	a	term	and	an	extended	class	or	classes	is	greater	than	the	maximum	number	of weeks	allowed	for	a	standard	term,	the	program	must	be	considered	a	nonstandard	term	program	for	Title	IV	program purposes.	For	example,	if	a	17-week	semester	contains	a	class	that	does	not	end	until	five	weeks	after	the	normal semester	end	date,	the	term	must	be	considered	nonstandard,	because	the	combined	length	of	the	term	and	the extended	class	is	22	weeks,	which	exceeds	the	maximum	21	weeks	permitted	for	a	semester.

There	is	an	exception	to	this	general	rule	for	standard	quarters	that	are	12	weeks	in	length.	A	12-week	quarter	may	still be	considered	a	standard	term	if	it	contains	a	class	or	classes	that	begin	not	more	than	two	weeks	before	the	official beginning	date	of	the	term	or	that	end	not	more	than	two	weeks	after	the	official	ending	date	of	the	term	(for	a	total period	not	to	exceed	two	weeks).	For	example,	a	12-week	quarter	containing	a	class	that	extends	two	weeks	beyond	the normal	term	ending	date	may	still	be	considered	a	standard	term,	even	though	the	combined	length	of	the	term	and	the extended	class	(14	weeks)	exceeds	the	maximum	13	weeks	allowed	for	a	quarter.

The	limited	exception	for	12-week	quarters	preserves	a	flexibility	that	was	allowed	under	the	policy	on	standard	term length	that	was	in	effect	prior	to	the	implementation	of	the	changes	described	in	the	November	5,	2019	Electronic Announcement.	Under	prior	policy	a	quarter	could	not	exceed	12	weeks,	but	a	quarter	with	a	class	or	classes	that extended	beyond	the	normal	term	beginning	or	ending	dates	by	not	more	than	two	weeks	could	still	be	considered	a standard	term.

Note	that	the	requirements	described	above	do	not	apply	to	standard	terms	in	a	subscription-based	academic	calendar. As	explained	earlier,	classes	in	a	subscription-based	program	are	not	required	to	begin	and	end	within	a	term.

Standard	terms	(including	standard	terms	in	a	subscription-based	program)	may	not	overlap	within	a	program.	In	addition, if	an	extended	class	overlaps	another	term	in	a	program	that	is	not	a	subscription-based	program,	the	program9s academic	calendar	must	be	treated	as	non-term.

## Combining	Modules	Into	a	Standard	Term

Except	for	subscription-based	programs,	in	a	program	using	a	standard	term	academic	calendar	you	may	combine	two	or more	consecutive	shorter	nonstandard	terms	(often	called	modules)	and	treat	them	as	a	single	standard	term	such	as	a semester	or	quarter.	For	example,	you	might	offer	a	program	in	a	series	of	modules,	each	of	which	is	six	weeks	in	length, with	students	earning	six	quarter	credits	in	each	module.	Although	a	single	6-week	module	could	not	constitute	a	quarter (because	it	contains	fewer	than	the	minimum	nine	weeks	required	for	a	quarter),	you	could	choose	to	treat	two consecutive	6-week	modules	as	a	single	12-week	quarter.

There	are	no	modules	in	subscription-based	programs	for	Title	IV	purposes.

## Standard	Term	Length

## November	5,	2019	Electronic	Announcement

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	2:	Combining	Modules

As	shown	below,	a	school	could	choose	to	group	three	5-week	modules	together	and	treat	them	as	a	15-week semester,	or	it	could	combine	four	4-week	modules	into	a	16-week	semester:

Module	1	(5	weeks)	+	Module	2	(5	weeks)	+	Module	3	(5	weeks)	= 15-week	semester

or

Module	1	(4	weeks)	+	Module	2	(4	weeks)	+	Module	3	(4	weeks)	+	Module	4	(4	weeks)	= 16-week	semester

On	the	other	hand,	programs	offered	in	modules	may	also	be	treated	as	nonstandard	term	or	non-term	programs. For	instance,	in	the	first	of	the	two	examples	shown	above	the	school	could	treat	each	5-week	module	as	a nonstandard	term	or	could	consider	this	to	be	a	non-term	program.	Whatever	academic	calendar	a	school	adopts for	a	program,	it	must	apply	the	calendar	to	all	students	enrolled	in	that	program	and	document	the	program9s treatment	in	its	policies	and	procedures	manual.

Intersessions

with	a	preceding	or	following	standard	term	and	treated	as	a	single	standard	term.	These	short	nonstandard	terms	are often	called	&lt;intersessions.=	For	example,	a	program	might	be	offered	in	an	academic	calendar	consisting	of	two	15-week semesters,	fall	and	spring,	with	a	4-week	intersession	between	the	two	semesters.	To	consider	the	program	as	being offered	in	standard	terms,	you	must	combine	the	intersession	with	either	the	fall	semester	or	the	spring	semester	and treat	the	combined	intersession	and	semester	as	a	single	term.	If	you	choose	to	take	this	approach,	the	same	treatment must	be	applied	for	all	Title	IV	purposes	to	all	students	enrolled	in	the	program.	In	addition,	hours	taken	in	the	intersession must	count	toward	a	student9s	enrollment	status	for	the	combined	term,	and	costs	for	the	intersession	must	be	included in	the	cost	of	attendance.

In	some	cases,	an	intersession	may	partially	overlap	one	or	more	standard	terms.	If	the	intersession	overlaps	just	one standard	term,	you	may	still	consider	the	program	to	be	offered	in	standard	terms	if	you	combine	the	overlapping intersession	with	the	standard	term	and	treat	that	combination	as	a	single	term,	as	described	above.

If	you	choose	not	to	combine	an	intersession	with	a	standard	term	as	described	above	and	instead	treat	the	intersession as	a	standalone	term,	or	if	an	intersession	partially	overlaps	more	than	one	standard	term,	the	program	must	be	treated as	a	non-term	program	for	Direct	Loans.	For	Pell	Grants	and	Teacher	Education	Assistance	for	College	and	Higher Education	(TEACH)	Grants,	you	would	be	required	to	use	Formula	3	if	you	treat	the	intersession	as	a	standalone	term,	or Formula	4	if	an	intersession	partially	overlaps	more	than	one	standard	term.	Regardless	of	whether	you	treat	an intersession	as	a	standalone	term	or	combine	it	with	a	standard	term,	you	may	not	have	a	policy	of	prohibiting	otherwise eligible	students	from	receiving	Title	IV	program	funds	to	cover	costs	associated	with	enrollment	in	the	intersession.

Intersessions	are	not	permitted	in	subscription-based	programs.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	3,	Combining	an	Intersession	With	a	Standard	Term

A	school	offers	a	degree	program	in	education	with	a	4-week	intersession	between	two	15-	week	semesters:

15-week	semester

4-week	intersession

15-week	semester

The	terms	don9t	overlap.	The	school	chooses	to	define	the	academic	year	for	this	program	as	24	semester	hours and	34	weeks	of	instructional	time.

The	school	may	combine	the	intersession	with	one	of	the	standard	terms,	and	treat	the	program	as	being	offered in	two	semesters:

19-week	semester

(15-week	fall	semester	+	4-week	intersession)

15-week	semester

or

15-week	semester

19-week	semester

(4-week	intersession	+	15-week	semester)

The	school	could	also	choose	not	to	combine	the	terms.	In	this	case,	the	program	would	have	a	4-week nonstandard	term	and	two	standard	terms	(semesters).	As	noted	earlier,	this	means	that	the	school	would	treat this	as	a	non-term	program	for	Direct	Loan	purposes	and	would	use	Formula	3	for	calculating	Pell	Grant	and TEACH	Grant	awards.

Inclusion	of	Clinical	Work	in	a	Standard	Term

Periods	of	medical	and	education	program	clinical	work	which	is	conducted	outside	the	classroom	may	not	be	included	in a	standard	term,	unless all of	the	following	apply:

- All	students	in	the	program	must	participate	in	the	practicum	or	clinical	experience,	and	they	must	be	required	to complete	the	practicum	or	clinical	experience	as	a	condition	for	applying	for	licensure	or	authorization	to	practice	the occupation	they	intend	to	pursue;
- The	school	has	little	or	no	control	over	the	length	or	starting	and	ending	dates	of	the	practicum	or	clinical experience.	This	may	be	due	to	constraints	imposed	by	outside	licensing	bodies	or	the	need	to	accommodate schedules	of	entities	with	which	students	are	being	placed	(e.g.,	school	districts	or	hospitals);	and
- Credit	hours	associated	with	the	practicum	or	clinical	experience	must	be	associated	with	the	term	in	which	most	of the	training	occurs,	even	if	the	starting	and	ending	dates	do	not	exactly	align	with	the	term	dates	and/or	overlap	with another	term.

If	the	clinical	work	meets all the	above	criteria,	terms	which	include	such	clinical	work	are	not	required	to	be	considered nonstandard,	nor	are	such	programs	required	to	be	considered	non-term,	even	if	the	clinical	work	overlaps	another	term. This	flexibility	is	limited	to	required	clinical	periods	associated	with	standard	term	programs	in	medicine	(including,	but not	limited	to,	allopathic,	osteopathic,	nursing,	veterinary,	dentistry,	pharmacy,	and	physical	therapy),	and	student teaching	required	to	obtain	a	state	teaching	certificate.

See	Volume	8,	Chapter	3	for	additional	guidance	on	certain	exceptions	to	the	normal	loan	period	and	disbursement	timing rules	for	Direct	Loans	when	clinical	work	that	meets	the	criteria	described	above	is	included	in	a	standard	term.

## Nonstandard	Terms

Generally,	nonstandard	terms	are	terms	that	are	not	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters.	For	example,	a	5-week	term	or	a 23-week	term	would	be	considered	a	nonstandard	term	because	no	standard	term	can	be	fewer	than	nine	weeks	or greater	than	21	weeks	in	length.	Like	standard	terms,	nonstandard	terms	may	be	equal	in	length	or	may	be	of	different lengths.	If	a	program	is	offered	in	a	combination	of	standard	terms	and	nonstandard	terms,	the	program	is	considered	to be	offered	in	nonstandard	terms.	Also,	like	standard	terms,	nonstandard	terms	may	not	overlap	within	a	program.

Even	if	a	school	calls	its	terms	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters,	they	are	considered	to	be	nonstandard	terms	if	they	do not	comply	with	the	policy	on	standard	term	length,	as	described	earlier.	For	instance,	a	22-week	semester	or	an	8-week quarter	must	be	treated	as	a	nonstandard	term,	because	a	semester	cannot	contain	more	than	21	weeks	and	a	quarter must	include	a	minimum	of	nine	weeks.

Semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters	are	also	considered	to	be	nonstandard	terms	if	academic	progress	is	not	measured	in the	manner	normally	associated	with	the	type	of	term.	For	example,	if	a	program	is	offered	in	15-week	semesters	but measures	academic	progress	in	quarter	credit	hours,	the	semesters	would	be	considered	nonstandard	terms.

## Non-Term	Characteristics

A	program	that	measures	progress	in	clock	hours	is	always	treated	as	a	non-term	program.

Except	for	subscription-based	programs,	a	program	that	measures	progress	in	credit-hours	is	considered	to	have	a	nonterm	calendar	if	it	has:

- Courses	that	do	not	begin	and	end	within	a	set	period	of	time	such	as	a	term;
- Courses	that	overlap	terms;
- Self-paced	and	independent	study	courses	that	overlap	terms;	or
- Sequential	courses	that	do	not	begin	and	end	within	a	term.

## Payment	Periods

The	payment	period	is	applicable	to	all	Title	IV	programs	except	the	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS)	Program.	For	example, Title	IV	program	disbursements	(except	FWS	payments)	must	be	made	on	a	payment	period	basis,	as	discussed	in	detail later	in	this	chapter.	Another	example	is	that	a	student9s	satisfactory	academic	progress	(SAP)	evaluation	must correspond	with	the	end	of	a	payment	period.

The	definition	of	a	payment	period	depends	on	the	kind	of	academic	calendar	your	school	uses	and	the	Title	IV	program for	which	you	are	disbursing	funds.	For	reference,	the	payment	period	definitions	described	in	detail	below	are summarized	in	in	the	table	titled	&lt;Payment	Period	Summary=	at	the	end	of	this	section.

Payment	Periods	for	Programs	Using	Standard	Terms	or	Substantially	Equal	Nonstandard	Terms

For	credit-hour	programs	with	standard	terms	or	with	nonstandard	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	in	length,	the payment	period	is	the	term.	Nonstandard	terms	are	considered	to	be	substantially	equal	in	length	if	no	term	in	a	program is	more	than	two	weeks	of	instructional	time	longer	than	any	other	term	in	the	program.

Payment	Periods	for	Programs	With	Nonstandard	Terms	Not	Substantially	Equal	in	Length

Nonstandard	terms	are	considered	to	be	not	substantially	equal	in	length	if	any	nonstandard	term	in	a	program	is	more than	two	weeks	of	instructional	time	longer	than	another	term	in	the	same	program.

For	the	Pell	Grant,	TEACH	Grant,	and	Federal	Supplemental	Educational	Opportunity	Grant	(FSEOG)	programs,	the payment	period	for	a	credit-hour	program	with	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal	in	length	is	the	term.

For	the	Direct	Loan	Program,	if	a	program	has	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal	in	length,	the	payment period	is	the	same	as	described	below	under	&lt;Payment	Periods	for	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Programs.=

Payment	Periods

Substantially	Equal	in	Length

## 34	CFR	668.4(h)(1)

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	4:	Payment	Periods	for	Programs	With	Nonstandard	Terms	Not	Substantially	Equal	in Length

For	a	nonstandard	term	program,	a	school	may	have	to	use	different	payment	periods	for	Direct	Loans	than	the payment	periods	used	for	Title	IV	grants.	In	this	example,	we	show	how	the	payment	periods	for	a	Pell	Grant	and a	Direct	Loan	can	differ	in	a	program	with	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal	in	length.	In	this program,	the	payment	periods	for	Pell	Grants	are	the	terms,	while	the	payment	periods	for	the	Direct	Loan	are the	non-term	payment	periods.	This	means	that	the	Direct	Loan	payment	periods	will	not	match	up	with	the payment	periods	used	for	the	Title	IV	grant	programs.	For	example,	the	first	Direct	Loan	payment	period	shown below	may	not	end	until	the	end	of	the	second	Pell	Grant	payment	period,	depending	on	when	the	student successfully	completes	the	credit	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	payment	period.

## Payment	Periods	for	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Programs

For	all	clock-hour	programs	and	for	credit-hour	programs	that	do	not	have	academic	terms,	payment	periods	are	defined based	on	a	student9s	successful	completion	of	clock	or	credit	hours and weeks	of	instructional	time,	as	described	below. As	noted	earlier,	these	same	payment	period	requirements	also	apply	when	disbursing	Direct	Loans	to	students	enrolled in	programs	with	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal	in	length.

A	student	successfully	completes	clock	or	credit	hours	if	the	school	considers	the	student	to	have	passed	the	coursework associated	with	those	hours.

Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Program	Payment	Periods	for	Programs	One	Academic	Year	or	Less	in	Length

- The	first	payment	period	is	the	period	in	which	the	student	successfully	completes	half	of	the	credit	or	clock	hours and half	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program.

- The	second	payment	period	is	the	period	in	which	the	student	completes	the	remainder	of	the	program.

Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Program	Payment	Periods	for	Programs	More	Than	One	Academic	Year	in	Length

- For	the	first	academic	year	of	the	program	and	for	any	subsequent	full	academic	year,	follow	the	payment	period rules	above	for	a	program	that	is	one	academic	year	or	less	in	length,	substituting	&lt;academic	year=	for	&lt;program.=

## Successfully	Completes

## 34	CFR	668.4(h)(2)

- For	any	remaining	portion	of	a	program	that	is	more	than	half	of	an	academic	year	(as	measured	in	both	clock	or credit	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional	time),	but	less	than	a	full	academic	year4
- The	first	payment	period	is	the	period	in	which	the	student	successfully	completes	half	of	the	credit	or	clock hours and half	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program;	and
- The	second	payment	period	is	the	period	of	time	in	which	the	student	successfully	completes	the	remainder	of the	program.
- For	any	remaining	portion	of	a	program	that	is	half	of	an	academic	year	or	less,	the	payment	period	is	the	remainder of	the	program.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	5:	Payment	Periods	for	Half-Time	Student	in	a	Non-Term	Program

The	illustration	below	shows	how	Pell	Grants	and	Direct	Loans	would	be	disbursed	for	a	student	enrolled	half-time in	a	program	of	48	semester	credits	that	a	full-time	student	completes	in	60	weeks	of	instructional	time.	For	this program,	the	school	has	defined	the	academic	year	as	24	semester	credits	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Under	the	regulations,	this	half-time	student	would	receive	second	disbursements	after	completing	half	of	the credit	hours and half	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	academic	year.	Because	the	student	in	the	example is	enrolled	only	half	time,	it	takes	the	student	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	to	successfully	complete	12	credit hours,	after	which	the	second	Pell	and	loan	disbursements	can	be	made.	The	student	is	eligible	for	a	new	loan	and a	new	Pell	Grant	once	the	student	has	successfully	completed	24	credit	hours	and	60	weeks.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Example	7:	Payment	Periods	for	Non-Term	Programs	More	Than	One	Academic	Year	in	Length

For	both	programs	illustrated	below,	the	school	defines	the	academic	year	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of instructional	time.	The	first	program	is	an	academic	year	with	a	remaining	portion	less	than	half	of	an	academic year;	the	second	program	is	an	academic	year	with	a	remaining	portion	greater	than	half	of	an	academic	year.

There	is	a	single	payment	period	for	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program,	since	at	least	one	of	the	measures (hours	and	weeks)	in	the	remaining	portion	is	half	of	an	academic	year	or	less.

There	are	two	payment	periods	for	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program	because both the	hours	and	weeks	in the	remaining	portion	are	more	than	half	of	an	academic	year.

## Payment	Periods	for	Clock-Hour	Programs	With	Terms

Although	some	schools	offer	clock-hour	programs	that	are	divided	into	terms	for	institutional	purposes,	for	Title	IV purposes	all	clock-hour	programs	are	considered	to	be	non-term	programs.	Therefore,	the	payment	periods	for	clock-hour programs	that	a	school	divides	into	terms	are	determined	in	the	same	way	as	described	above	under	&lt;Payment	Periods for	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Programs.=	Because	a	student	enrolled	in	such	a	program	must	successfully	complete	all	the clock	hours	in	the	payment	period	before	the	next	payment	period	begins,	the	payment	period	starting	dates	may	not coincide	with	the	starting	dates	of	the	terms	in	the	program.

Counting	Excused	Absences	in	Clock-Hour	Programs	Toward	Payment	Period	Completion

In	a	clock-hour	program,	you	are	allowed	to	count	a	limited	number	of	excused	absences	when	deciding	whether	the student	has	completed	the	hours	in	a	payment	period.	An	excused	absence	may	only	be	counted	if	the	student	is	excused from	hours	that	were	actually	scheduled	but	were	missed	and	do	not	have	to	be	made	up	for	the	student	to	receive	the degree	or	certificate	for	the	program.

For	instance,	a	student	in	a	program	that	has	450-clock-hour	payment	periods	might	miss	20	clock	hours	and	only	have attended	430	clock	hours	at	the	point	where	other	students	who	did	not	miss	any	clock	hours	have	received	450	clock hours	of	instruction.	If	your	school	has	an	excused	absences	policy,	the	20	missed	clock	hours	are	considered	excused, and	this	student	could	be	paid	the	next	disbursement.

## Timing	of	Disbursements

Except	for	FWS	wages,	Title	IV	disbursements	are	made	on	a	payment	period	basis	as	described	below.	Except	when making	late	disbursements	or	retroactive	payments	for	completed	payment	periods	(as	discussed	in	Volume	4,	Chapter 2),	you	must	disburse	the	Title	IV	funds	during	the	payment	period	to	which	they	apply.

Note: We	do	not	cover	the	requirements	for	reporting	disbursements	through	the	Common	Origination	and Disbursement	(COD)	System	or	the	rules	for	making	early	disbursements,	late	disbursements,	or	retroactive payments	in	this	section.	For	guidance	on	those	topics,	refer	to	Volume	4,	Chapter	2.	We	also	do	not	cover	certain disbursement	requirements	that	are	specific	to	the	Title	IV	grant	programs	or	the	Direct	Loan	Program.	For information	on	those	requirements,	see	Volumes	6,	7,	8,	and	9.

Disbursements	by	Payment	Period

HEA	Sec.	428G

34	CFR	668.164(b)

Disbursement	Timing	in	Term-Based	Programs	Using	Credit	Hours	(Except	Subscription-Based	Programs)

As	noted	earlier	in	the	chapter,	for	the	Pell	Grant,	TEACH	Grant,	and	FSEOG	programs	the	payment	period	is	the	academic term	for	a	student	enrolled	in	a	credit-hour	program	that	uses	any	type	of	academic	term	(standard	or	nonstandard).	For the	Direct	Loan	Program,	the	payment	period	is	the	academic	term	only	if	the	program	uses	standard	terms	or	uses nonstandard	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	in	length.	If	the	program	uses	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially equal	in	length,	a	school	must	use	the	non-term-based	rules	for	Direct	Loan	disbursement	timing,	as	discussed	in	the	next section	below.

Except	as	noted	above	for	the	Direct	Loan	Program,	there	is	no	requirement	for	a	student	who	is	enrolled	in	a	credit-hour term	program	that	is	not	a	subscription-based	program	to	successfully	complete	a	certain	amount	of	coursework	in	a payment	period	before	they	can	receive	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV	funds	in	the	next	payment	period.	For	instance,	a student	could	receive	a	Pell	Grant	or	Direct	Loan	disbursement	in	the	spring	term	after	failing	several	courses	in	the	fall term,	provided	that	the	student	is	still	making	satisfactory	academic	progress	under	the	school9s	policy.

Disbursement	Timing	in	Clock-Hour,	Non-Term,	and	Certain	Nonstandard	Term	Programs

A	student	who	is	enrolled	in	a	credit-hour	program	without	terms	or	in	a	clock-hour	program	must	successfully	complete both the	credit	or	clock	hours and the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	a	payment	period	before	receiving	a	disbursement	of Pell	Grant,	FSEOG,	TEACH	Grant	or	Direct	Loan	funds	for	the	next	payment	period.	For	the	Direct	Loan	Program	only,	this same	requirement	applies	to	students	who	are	enrolled	in	programs	with	nonstandard	terms	that	are	not	substantially equal	in	length.

Effect	of	Accelerated	Progression	on	Disbursement	Timing	in	a	Clock-Hour	or	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Program

The	Pell	Grant	or	TEACH	Grant	amount	that	a	student	is	eligible	to	receive	for	a	payment	period	in	a	clock-hour	or	nonterm	credit-hour	program	is	based	on	the	number	of	hours	and	weeks	in	the	scheduled	payment	periods	for	the	program that	are	established	at	the	beginning	of	the	program	based	on	the	program	length	(as	described	earlier	in	this	chapter). These	scheduled	payment	periods	do	not	change,	regardless	of	a	student9s	rate	of	progression	through	a	clock-hour	or non-term	credit-hour	program.	This	means	that	if	a	student	completes	additional	weeks	of	instructional	time	or	hours while	completing	the	other	measure	of	a	payment	period,	the	actual	number	of	weeks	or	hours	that	the	student completes	before	a	disbursement	can	be	made	for	the	next	payment	period	may	differ	from	the	number	of	weeks	or	hours in	the	scheduled	payment	period	used	to	determine	the	student9s	grant	amount	for	the	payment	period.

Although	a	student9s	completion	of	additional	weeks	or	hours	in	a	payment	period	has	no	effect	on	the	scheduled payment	periods	for	purposes	of	determining	Pell	Grant	and	TEACH	Grant	payment	amounts,	an	undergraduate	student who	accelerates	in	a	clock-hour	or	non-term	credit-hour	program	may	have	reduced	Direct	Loan	eligibility	in	the	final academic	year	of	a	program.	Specifically,	if	a	student	enrolled	in	a	program	that	is	greater	than	one	academic	year	in length	completes	additional	clock	or	credit	hours	prior	to	the	final	academic	year	of	the	program,	this	may	result	in	a	final period	of	study	that	contains	fewer	clock	or	credit	hours	than	the	number	of	hours	in	the	program9s	defined	academic year.	In	this	circumstance,	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	an	undergraduate	student	must	be	prorated	(reduced).

The	principles	described	above	are	illustrated	by	the	examples	in	Appendix	A	at	the	end	of	this	chapter.	For	guidance	on calculating	Pell	Grant	and	TEACH	Grant	awards	for	clock-hour	and	non-term	credit-hour	programs,	see	Volume	7.	For information	on	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	proration	and	annual	loan	limit	progression	in	clock-hour	and	non-term	credithour	programs,	see	Volume	8,	Chapters	5	and	6.

If	your	school	is	unable	to	determine	when	a	student	has	successfully	completed	half	of	the	credit	or	clock	hours	in	a program,	academic	year,	or	remainder	of	a	program,	the	student	is	considered	to	have	begun	the	second	payment	period of	the	program,	academic	year,	or	remainder	of	a	program	at	the	later	of	the	date	(identified	by	your	school)	that	the student	has	successfully	completed:

- half	of	the	academic	coursework	in	the	program,	academic	year,	or	remainder	of	the	program;	or
- half	of	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program,	academic	year,	or	remainder	of	the	program.

## Disbursement	Timing	in	Subscription-Based	Programs

For	the	first	two	subscription	periods	(terms)	that	a	student	attends	in	a	subscription-based	program,	there	is	no requirement	for	the	student	to	have	completed	a	certain	amount	of	coursework	before	receiving	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV funds	(the	same	as	in	any	other	term-based	program	using	credit	hours).	However,	to	receive	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV aid	for	each	subsequent	subscription	period	in	the	program,	the	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	number	of credit	hours	equal	to	the	total	of	the	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	all	previously	attended subscription	periods	in	the	program,	excluding	the	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	the	most recently	attended	subscription	period.	For	more	detailed	guidance	on	the	disbursement	rules	for	subscription-based programs,	including	examples,	refer	to	Appendix	B	at	the	end	of	this	chapter.

## Multiple	Disbursements	Within	a	Payment	Period

The	regulations	governing	the	Title	IV	programs	generally	permit	schools	to	pay	Title	IV	funds	at	such	times	and	in	such installments within each	payment	period	as	will	best	meet	students9	needs.	This	gives	schools	the	ability	to	apportion	the payment	if	doing	so	will	be	in	the	best	interest	of	the	student.	For	example,	if	a	payment	period	is	particularly	long,	a school	might	choose	to	pay	in	multiple	installments	to	the	extent	program	requirements	permit	to	ensure	that	a	student will	have	funds	to	pay	rent	later	in	the	payment	period.	If	a	school	chooses	to	schedule	multiple	Direct	Loan disbursements	within	a	single	payment	period,	the	disbursements	must	be	substantially	equal.	Note	also	that	if	the	loan period	for	a	Direct	Loan	is	a	single	payment	period,	the	loan must be	disbursed	in	at	least	two	installments	unless	the school	qualifies	for	an	exception	to	the	multiple	disbursement	requirement.	See	Volume	8,	Chapter	3	for	more information.

Schools	that	use	payment	periods	as	the	basis	for	their	Return	of	Title	IV	Funds	calculations	should	note	that	making multiple	disbursements	within	a	payment	period	does	not	create	a	new	or	additional	payment	period.	See	Volume	5	of	the FSA	Handbook	for	information	on	how	withdrawal	calculations	handle	multiple	disbursements.

Disbursement	Rules	for	Terms	With	Modules

When	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	term-based	program	in	which	the	terms	are	divided	into	two	or	more	modules,	but	the student	won9t	attend	the	first	module,	the	date	when	classes	begin	for	making	disbursements	is	the	starting	date	of	the first	module	that	the	student	will	attend.

For	example,	the	earliest	the	school	can	pay	a	student	who	is	scheduled	to	begin	attendance	in	the	second	of	three	5week	modules	that	make	up	a	semester	is	10	days	before	the	first	day	of	the	second	module	(or	30	days	after	the	second module	begins,	if	the	student	is	a	first-time,	first-year	borrower	and	the	school	does	not	meet	the	requirements	for	an exemption	from	the	delayed	disbursement	requirement	for	such	students,	as	described	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2).

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	A:	Non-Term	Examples

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	A,	Example	1:	Clock-Hour	Program	Payment	Periods	3	Student	Must	Repeat	Course

A	student	enrolls	in	a	1-year	clock-hour	program	with	an	academic	year	(AY)	of	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of instructional	time.	The	program	consists	of	six	successive	graded	courses,	each	of	which	has	150	clock	hours.	The scheduled	payment	periods	are	one-half	of	the	length	of	the	program	in	clock	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional time:	450	clock	hours	and	13	weeks	of	instructional	time.

The	student	in	this	example	fails	the	second	course,	but	immediately	repeats	it	and	passes.	The	student successfully	completes	all	other	courses	in	the	program.

The	school	cannot	make	the	second	Pell	and	Direct	Loan	disbursements	until	the	student	has	successfully completed	both	the	clock	hours	and	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	first	payment	period.	Because	the student	must	repeat	the	second	course	of	the	program	(taking	an	additional	three	weeks	to	do	so),	the	school must	reschedule	the	date	of	the	second	Pell	and	Direct	Loan	disbursements.	The	second	disbursements	will	now be	made	after	the	student	has	successfully	completed	450	clock	hours	and	attended	for	16	weeks	of	instructional time,	and	the	school	will	need	to	report	the	rescheduled	second	disbursement	dates	to	COD.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	A,	Example	2:	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Program	Payment	Periods	3	Additional	Weeks Completed	in	First	Academic	Year

A	non-term,	two-year	program	of	48	semester	hours	and	60	weeks	of	instructional	time	has	an	academic	year	of 24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	There	are	four	scheduled	payment	periods,	each	of	which is	equal	to	one-half	of	the	defined	academic	year:	12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Students	in	the	program	are	expected	to	complete	the	first	24	hours	over	36	weeks	of	instructional	time,	and	the final	24	semester	hours	in	24	weeks	of	instructional	time.	Students	complete	each	of	hours	1-12	and	13-24	in	18 weeks	of	instructional	time	and	each	of	hours	of	25-36	and	37-48	in	12	weeks	of	instructional	time.

## Scheduled	payment	periods

| First year of program                         | First year of program                         | Second year of program                        | Second year of program                        |

## Progression	through	payment	periods	for	disbursements	(student	cannot	receive	next	disbursement until	successful	completion	of	BOTH	hours	and	weeks	in	scheduled	payment	periods)

<!-- image -->

The	scheduled	payment	periods	are	12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	of	instructional	time,	but	the	student	in	this example	takes	18	weeks	to	complete	the	first	12	hours.	Therefore,	the	second	disbursements	of	the	first	Pell Grant	award	and	the	Direct	Loan	for	the	first	academic	year	of	the	program	cannot	be	made	until	the	19th	week of	instruction.	This	is	because	the	next	grant	or	loan	disbursement	cannot	begin	until	the	student	successfully completes both the	credit	or	clock-hours	and	the	weeks	of	instruction	in	the	previous	scheduled	payment	period.

It	takes	the	student	another	18	weeks	to	complete	the	second	12	hours	in	the	program,	meaning	that	the	first disbursements	of	the	second	Pell	Grant	award	and	the	Direct	Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program cannot	be	made	until	the	37th	week	of	instruction	(this	corresponds	to	when	the	student	officially	enters	the	3rd scheduled	payment	period).	Based	on	the	scheduled	payment	periods	a	student	cannot	enter	the	4th	payment period	until	the	student	has	completed	at	least	45	weeks	and	36	semester	hours	(12	semester	hours	and	15 weeks	within	each	payment	period).

After	the	student	has	successfully	completed	36	weeks	of	instruction	and	24	semester	hours,	there	are	24	weeks and	24	hours	remaining	in	the	program.	The	second	disbursements	of	the	second	Pell	Grant	award	and	the	Direct Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program	cannot	be	made	until	the	student	officially	enters	the	4th scheduled	payment	period,	which	occurs	after	the	student	has	cumulatively	completed	36	semester	hours	and	48 weeks.

Remember	that	the	Pell	Grant	amount	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	in	each	of	the	four	payment	periods	is always	based	on	the	scheduled	payment	periods	of	12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Although	the	academic	year	for	the	program	is	defined	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time, students	are	expected	to	complete	the	first	24	hours	over	36	weeks	of	instructional	time.	To	ensure	that	the	loan period	for	the	student9s	first	Direct	Loan	covers	both	measures	of	the	defined	academic	year,	the	school	must originate	a	loan	for	a	loan	period	covering	36	weeks	of	instructional	time.

The	Direct	Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program	will	be	originated	for	a	loan	period	covering	24 weeks	of	instructional	time.	Although	this	is	fewer	weeks	than	the	number	of	weeks	in	the	program9s	defined academic	year,	the	number	of	semester	hours	remaining	in	the	program	(24)	equals	the	number	of	hours	in	the academic	year.	Therefore,	proration	of	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	is	not	required.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	A,	Example	3:	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Program	Payment	Periods	3	More	Hours	Earned in	the	First	Academic	Year

A	school	offers	a	non-term,	two-year	program	of	48	semester	hours	and	60	weeks	of	instructional	time,	with	the academic	year	defined	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	There	are	four	scheduled payment	periods,	each	of	which	is	equal	to	one-half	of	the	defined	academic	year:	12	semester	hours	and	15 weeks	of	instructional	time.

Students	are	expected	to	complete	the	first	30	semester	hours	over	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	first period	of	enrollment.	They	are	then	expected	to	complete	18	semester	hours	in	the	last	30	weeks	of	instructional time.

Progression	through	payment	periods	for	disbursements	(student	cannot	receive	next	disbursement until	successful	completion	of	BOTH	hours	and	weeks	in	scheduled	payment	periods)

<!-- image -->

The	scheduled	payment	periods	are	12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	second disbursements	of	the	first	Pell	Grant	award	and	the	Direct	Loan	for	the	first	academic	year	of	the	program	are made	after	the	student	has	successfully	completed both the	hours	and	weeks	components	of	the	first	scheduled payment	period.	In	this	example,	the	student	has	earned	15	hours	after	completing	the	15-weeks	in	the	first scheduled	payment	period.	The	student	then	earns	another	15	hours	after	completing	the	15	weeks	in	the	second scheduled	payment	period.

After	the	student	has	successfully	completed	30	weeks	of	instruction	and	30	semester	hours,	there	are	30	weeks and	18	hours	remaining	in	the	program.	The	first	disbursements	of	the	second	Pell	Grant	award	and	the	Direct Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program	cannot	be	made	until	the	31st	week	of	instruction (corresponds	to	when	the	student	officially	enters	the	3rd	scheduled	payment	period).

The	second	disbursements	of	the	second	Pell	Grant	award	and	the	Direct	Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of the	program	cannot	be	made	until	the	student	officially	enters	the	4th	scheduled	payment	period,	which	occurs after	the	student	has	cumulatively	completed	39	semester	hours	and	45	weeks.	Based	on	the	scheduled	payment periods	a	student	cannot	enter	the	4th	payment	period	until	the	student	has	completed	at	least	45	weeks	and	36 semester	hours	(12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	within	each	payment	period)

As	in	Example	2,	remember	that	the	Pell	Grant	amount	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	in	each	of	the	four payment	periods	is	always	based	on	the	scheduled	payment	periods	of	12	semester	hours	and	15	weeks	of instructional	time.

The	student9s	Direct	Loan	for	the	first	academic	year	of	the	program	will	be	originated	for	a	loan	period	covering 30	weeks	of	instructional	time,	since	a	student	will	complete	the	hours	in	the	defined	academic	year	within	that period.

* Note: The	student9s	Direct	Loan	for	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program	will	also	be	originated	for	a	loan period	covering	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	However,	because	the	number	of	semester	hours	remaining	in	the program	(18)	is	less	than	the	number	of	hours	in	the	program9s	defined	academic	year	(24),	the	student	is	in	a remaining	period	of	study	shorter	than	an	academic	year.	Therefore,	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	the second	year	of	the	program	(the	maximum	Direct	Loan	amount	the	student	may	receive	for	the	3rd	and	4th payment	periods)	must	be	prorated.

## Programs

As	we	explained	under	&lt;Disbursement	timing	in	subscription-based	programs=	earlier	in	this	chapter,	there	is	no requirement	for	a	student	to	have	completed	a	specified	amount	of	coursework	before	receiving	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV funds	for	the	first	two	subscription	periods	(terms)	in	a	subscription-based	program.	However,	to	receive	a	disbursement for	the	third	subscription	period	and	for	each	subsequent	subscription	period	in	the	program,	a	student	must	have completed	a	cumulative	number	of	credit	hours	equal	to	the	total	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in all	previously	attended	subscription	periods	in	the	program,	excluding	the	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	was enrolled	in	the	most	recently	attended	subscription	period.

The	cumulative	number	of	hours	that	a	student	must	have	completed	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	third	subscription period	and	for	each	subsequent	subscription	period	is	based	on	the	student's	enrollment	status	for	the	program.	Each subscription	period	that	a	student	attends	is	associated	with	a	number	of	credit	hours	based	on	the	student's	enrollment status.	A	school	establishes	an	enrollment	status	(for	example,	full-time	or	half-time)	that	will	apply	to	a	student throughout	the	student's	enrollment	in	a	subscription-based	program,	except	that	a	student	may	change	their	enrollment status	no	more	often	than	once	per	academic	year.	For	example,	if	the	program	is	a	full-time	program	and	the	school's full-time	standard	is	12	semester	or	quarter	hours,	each	subscription	period	will	be	associated	with	12	hours.	For	a student	receiving	Pell	Grants	in	a	subscription-based	program,	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	would	correspond	to	the enrollment	status	established	for	the	program	and	would	not	vary.	For	example,	in	a	full-time	subscription-based	program the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	would	be	set	at	100%,	and	in	a	half-time	program	it	would	be	set	at	50%.	(See	Volume 7,	Chapter	3	for	guidance	on	determining	Pell	Grant	enrollment	intensity	in	other	types	of	programs.)	As	a	student progresses	through	a	subscription-based	program,	the	number	of	hours	associated	with	each	term	are	added	to	the cumulative	total	needed	for	the	student	to	receive	a	disbursement.

For	the	first	two	terms	in	a	subscription-based	program,	a	school	can	make	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV	funds	up	to	10	days before	the	beginning	of	the	subscription	period.	Beginning	with	the	third	subscription	period,	early	disbursement	10	days before	the	beginning	of	the	term	is	allowed	only	if	at	that	point	the	student	has	completed	the	required	number	of	credit hours	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	term.	Otherwise,	the	school	cannot	make	a	disbursement	until	the	student	has met	the	coursework	completion	requirement.

Note	that	a	student	who	has	not	begun	attendance	in	any	new	coursework	during	a	particular	subscription	period	is ineligible	to	receive	Title	IV	program	funds	for	that	period,	even	if	the	student	would	otherwise	qualify	to	receive	a disbursement	based	on	coursework	completion	requirements.	This	means,	for	example,	that	although	there	is	no coursework	completion	requirement	for	a	student	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	second	term	of	a	subscription-based program,	the	student	would	not	be	eligible	for	the	disbursement	if	they	simply	continue	attendance	in	coursework	that they	began	during	the	first	subscription	period	without	having	begun	attendance	in	any	new	coursework	during	the second	subscription	period.	If	a	disbursement	is	made	to	a	student	who	did	not	begin	attendance	in	any	new	coursework during	a	subscription	period,	the	requirements	described	under	"When	a	Student	Fails	to	Begin	Attendance"	in	Volume	4, Chapter	3	of	the	FSA	Handbook	apply.

Once	the	cumulative	number	of	credit	hours	from	earlier	subscription	periods	that	is	required	to	receive	a	disbursement for	a	later	subscription	period	equals	or	exceeds	the	total	number	of	credit	hours	required	to	complete	the	program,	a student is	no	longer	eligible	to	receive	Title	IV	funds	for	the	program.

The	principles	described	above	are	illustrated	in	the	examples	that	follow.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	B,	Example	1:	Subscription-Based	Program	Course	Completion	Requirement	(Student Maintains	Same	Enrollment	Status)

- A	school	offers	a	two-year	subscription-based	program	of	consisting	of	48	semester	hours,	with	the	academic year	defined	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.
- The	academic	year	consists	of	fall	and	spring	semesters,	with	an	optional	summer	term.	In	this	example,	the student	does	not	attend	in	the	summer	term.
- The	school	defines	full-time	as	12	semester	hours	per	term.	The	student	is	enrolled	in	the	full-time	version	of

As	shown	above,	there	is	no	coursework	completion	requirement	for	the	student	to	receive	a	Title	IV	disbursement	for	the first	and	second	subscription	periods	in	the	program.

| Credit hours associated with term: 12 Cumulative hours required to receive disbursement: 12 (= hours enrolled in subscription period 1) | Credit hours associated with term: 12 Cumulative hours required to receive disbursement: 24 (= total hours enrolled in subscription periods 1 & 2) |

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	3,	the	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	number	of	credit hours	equal	to	the	total	number	of	credit	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	all	previously	attended	terms, excluding	the	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	the	most	recently	attended	term.	Thus,	the	student cannot	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	3	until	they	have	completed	a	total	of	12	credit	hours,	the	number of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	period	1.	The	12	hours	for	which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	the	most	recently	attended term	(subscription	period	2)	are	not	counted.

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	4,	the	student	must	have	completed	24	credit	hours,	the	cumulative number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1	and	2.

If	the	student	has	not	completed	the	48	hours	in	the	program	by	the	end	of	subscription	period	4,	they	could	receive	Title IV	funds	for	one	additional	term,	as	shown	below.

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	5,	the	student	must	have	completed	36	credit	hours,	the	cumulative number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1,	2,	and	3.

The	student	is	not	eligible	to	receive	any	additional	Title	IV	funds	after	subscription	period	5,	because	the	cumulative number	of	hours	required	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	next	subscription	period	would	be	48,	which	is	the	total number	of	hours	in	the	program.

The	scenario	in	this	example	is	the	same	as	in	Example	1,	except	that	the	student	changes	to	the	half-time version	of	the	program	in	the	second	academic	year.

As	in	Example	1,	there	is	no	coursework	completion	requirement	for	the	student	to	receive	a	Title	IV	disbursement	for	the first	and	second	subscription	periods	in	the	program.

| Credit hours associated with term: 6 Cumulative hours required to receive disbursement: 12 (= hours enrolled in subscription period 1) | Credit hours associated with term: 6 Cumulative hours required to receive disbursement: 24 (= total hours enrolled in subscription periods 1 & 2) |

The	student	changes	to	the	half-time	version	of	the	program	in	the	second	academic	year.	However,	because	the	course completion	requirements	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	a	subscription	period	are	cumulative	across	multiple	versions	of the	same	program	(full-time,	half-time,	etc.),	the	counting	of	the	hours	required	for	disbursement	does	not	start	over when	a	student	changes	to	a	different	version	of	a	program.

As	in	Example	1,	the	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	total	of	12	credit	hours	(the	number	of	hours	enrolled	in subscription	period	1)	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	3,	and	a	cumulative	total	of	24	hours	(the	total number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1	and	2)	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	4.	The student's	change	to	the	half-time	version	of	the	program	in	the	second	academic	year	does	not	affect	the	cumulative number	of	hours	required	to	receive	disbursements	for	subscription	periods	3	and	4,	because	that	number	is	based	on	the number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1	and	2,	when	the	student	was	enrolled	in	the	full-time	version	of	the program.

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	5,	the	student	must	have	completed	30	credit	hours,	the	cumulative number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1,	2,	and	3.	(Note	that	as	a	result	of	the	student's	change	to	the	half-time version	of	the	program	in	subscription	period	3,	this	is	6	fewer	hours	than	the	number	of	hours	required	to	receive	a disbursement	for	subscription	period	5	in	Example	1.)	The	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	total	of	36	hours	to receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	6.

If	the	student	has	not	completed	the	48	hours	in	the	program	by	the	end	of	subscription	period	6,	they	would	be	eligible to	receive	aid	for	one	additional	subscription	period,	as	shown	below.

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	7,	the	student	must	have	completed	42	credit	hours,	the	cumulative number	of	hours	enrolled	in	subscription	periods	1,	2,	3,	4,	and	5.

The	student	is	not	eligible	to	receive	any	additional	Title	IV	funds	after	subscription	period	7,	because	the	cumulative number	of	hours	required	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	next	subscription	period	would	be	48,	which	is	the	total number	of	hours	in	the	program.

To	receive	a	disbursement	for	the	third	subscription	period	and	for	each	subsequent	subscription	period	in	the	program, the	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	number	of	credit	hours	equal	to	the	total	number	of	hours	for	which	the student	was	enrolled	in	all	previously	attended	subscription	periods	in	the	program,	excluding	the	number	of	hours	for which	the	student	was	enrolled	in	the	most	recently	attended	subscription	period.

As	shown	above,	for	each	of	the	three	subscription	periods	in	the	second	academic	year	of	the	program	the	student	meets the	course	completion	requirement	to	receive	disbursements	at	the	beginning	of	the	term.	For	example,	the	student	had completed	a	total	of	21	credit	hours	by	the	end	of	subscription	period	#2,	which	exceeds	the	minimum	12	hours	required to	receive	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#3.

In	the	third	academic	year	of	the	program,	the	student	meets	the	course	completion	requirement	to	receive disbursements	at	the	beginning	of	subscription	period	#6.	However,	the	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#7	must be	delayed	until	the	student	has	completed	an	additional	three	credit	hours.	This	is	because	the	student	must	have completed	a	cumulative	total	of	at	least	60	credit	hours	to	receive	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#7,	but	at	the end	of	subscription	period	#6	the	student	had	earned	only	57	hours.

At	the	end	of	subscription	period	#7,	the	student	has	earned	a	cumulative	total	of	69	credit	hours.	Because	72	hours	are required	for	the	student	to	receive	a	disbursement	in	subscription	period	#8,	the	disbursements	for	that	subscription period	must	be	delayed	until	the	student	has	completed	an	additional	three	hours.	The	student	has	earned	a	cumulative total	of	84	hours	at	the	end	of	subscription	period	#8,	which	is	the	number	of	hours	required	to	receive	a	disbursement	for subscription	period	#9.	Therefore,	the	disbursements	for	the	final	subscription	period	in	the	program	can	be	made	at	the beginning	of	the	term.

- A	school	offers	a	two-year	subscription-based	program	of	consisting	of	48	semester	hours,	with	the	academic year	defined	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	school	defines	full-time	as	12 hours.
- The	student	receives	Pell	Grants	and	Direct	Loans.
- Pell	Grants	are	calculated	using	Formula	1.
- For	purposes	of	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	progression,	the	school	uses	Borrower-Based Academic	Year	2	(BBAY	2)	consisting	of	any	two	consecutive	semesters	(see	Volume	8,	Chapter	6	for	more information	on	BBAYs	and	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	progression).

In	Example	4,	the	student	meets	the	course	completion	requirements	to	receive	disbursements	at	the	beginning	of	each subscription	period.

For	Direct	Loan	purposes,	the	school	originates	a	single-term	loan	for	subscription	period	#5	(i.e.,	the	loan	period beginning	and	ending	dates	correspond	to	the	beginning	and	ending	dates	of	the	subscription	period).	Because	the	school does	not	meet	the	cohort	default	rate	standard	that	would	allow	for	a	single-term	Direct	Loan	to	be	disbursed	in	one installment,	the	student's	Direct	Loans	for	subscription	period	#5	must	be	disbursed	in	two	substantially	equal installments,	with	the	second	disbursement	made	at	the	calendar	midpoint	of	the	loan	period.	(Note	also	that	because	this subscription	period	is	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit must	be	prorated	based	on	the	six	hours	remaining	in	the	program	at	the	end	of	subscription	period	#4.	See	Volume	8,

Chapter	5	for	information	on	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	proration).

Because	the	student	is	enrolled	in	the	full-time	version	of	the	program,	the	number	of	credit	hours	associated	with subscription	period	#5	is	12.	However,	the	student	attends	only	six	hours	(the	remaining	number	of	hours	in	the	program for	Title	IV	purposes).	The	student's	Pell	Grant	award	for	subscription	period	#5	is	determined	based	on	an	enrollment intensity	of	50%,	and	the	student's	enrollment	status	for	that	term	is	reported	to	NSLDS	as	half-time.

Note	that	even	if	the	student	has	not	completed	the	remaining	six	hours	in	the	program	by	the	end	of	subscription	period #5,	there	is	no	aid	eligibility	after	that	term,	because	the	cumulative	number	of	hours	that	would	be	required	to	receive	a disbursement	for	the	next	term	is	48,	which	is	the	total	number	of	hours	in	the	program.

Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	Appendix	B,	Example	5:	Subscription-Based	Program	Disbursement	Timing

The	details	of	the	program	illustrated	in	Example	5	are	the	same	as	for	the	program	described	in	Example	4.

In	Example	5,	the	student	meets	the	coursework	completion	requirements	to	receive	disbursements	at	the	beginning	of the	first	three	subscription	periods.	However,	at	the	end	of	subscription	period	#3	the	student	has	completed	a cumulative	total	of	21	hours,	and	24	hours	are	required	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	#4.	The	school makes	the	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#4	after	the	student	has	completed	an	additional	three	hours.

As	in	Example	4,	the	school	originates	a	single-term	loan	for	subscription	period	#5,	which	is	a	remaining	period	of	study that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year.	The	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	based	on	the	21	hours remaining	in	the	program	as	of	the	end	of	subscription	period	#4.

The	student	must	have	completed	a	cumulative	total	of	36	hours	to	receive	a	disbursement	for	subscription	period	#5. During	subscription	period	#5	the	student	completes	only	an	additional	six	hours,	resulting	in	a	cumulative	total	of	33 hours	completed.	Therefore,	the	school	makes	the	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#5	as	late	disbursements	after the	student	has	completed	an	additional	three	hours.	Because	the	loan	period	is	equal	to	a	single	payment	period	and more	than	half	of	the	payment	period	has	elapsed,	the	school	may	disburse	the	student's	Direct	Loan	for	subscription period	#5	in	a	single	late	disbursement.

After	the	student	has	earned	the	additional	three	hours	required	to	receive	late	disbursements	for	subscription	period	#5 (resulting	in	a	cumulative	total	of	36	hours	completed),	there	are	12	hours	remaining	in	the	program.	Note	that	there	is	no aid	eligibility	for	the	remaining	12	hours,	because	the	cumulative	number	of	hours	that	would	be	required	to	receive	a disbursement	for	the	next	term	is	48,	which	is	the	total	number	of	hours	in	the	program.

Awards	for	most	of	the	Title	IV	programs	are	based	on	some	form	of	financial	need.	Unlike	scholarship	programs	that	may award	funds	based	on	academic	merit	or	the	student9s	field	of	study,	&lt;need-based=	grants,	loans,	and	work-study	are based	on	the	student9s	demonstrated	financial	need	for	assistance.	The	cost	of	attendance	(COA)	is	the	cornerstone	of establishing	a	student9s	financial	need,	as	it	sets	a	limit	on	the	total	aid	that	a	student	may	receive	for	purposes	of	the Campus-Based,	TEACH	Grant,	and	Direct	Loan	programs,	and	is	one	of	the	basic	components	of	the	Pell	Grant	calculation.

This	chapter	picks	up	at	the	point	where	the	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	for	a	student	has	been	determined.	See	Chapter	3	of the	Application	and	Verification	Guide	for	more	information	on	the	SAI,	and	Volume	1	for	more	information	on	basic student	eligibility	requirements.	Most	schools	establish	average	costs	for	different	categories	of	students	and	set	these cost	categories	in	EDExpress	or	other	software	that	they	use	to	determine	awards	and	package	aid.	The	typical	costs	that you	establish	for	your	students	will	be	used	to	calculate	their	Title	IV	award	amounts	and	package	their	aid.

## Allowable	Costs

The	HEA	specifies	the	types	of	costs	that	are	included	in	the	COA,	but	each	school	must	determine	the	appropriate	and reasonable	amounts	to	include	for	each	eligible	COA	category	for	its	students,	based	on	the	criteria	described	in	this chapter.

The	COA	for	a	student	is	an	estimate	of	that	student9s	educational	expenses	for	the	period	of	enrollment.	As	you9ll	see,	in most	cases	you	can	use	average	expenses	(for	students	with	the	same	enrollment	status)	at	your	school,	rather	than actual	expenses.	For	example,	for	the	tuition	and	fees	component,	you	can	use	the	same	average	amount	for	all	full-time students	instead	of	figuring	the	actual	tuition	and	fees	for	each	individual	student.	You	can	have	different	standard	costs for	different	categories	of	students,	such	as	one	COA	for	out-of-state	students,	who	are	charged	higher	tuition,	and	a different	COA	for	in-state	students,	who	are	charged	lower	tuition.	However,	you	cannot	combine	the	COA	figures	for	each separate	enrollment	status	and	award	aid	to	a	student	based	on	the	average	COA.	Students	must	be	awarded	based	on	a COA	comprised	of	allowable	costs	assessed	all	students	carrying	the	same	academic	workload.

If	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	program	that	has	extra	fees	or	costs,	such	as	lab	fees,	you	can	add	those	fees	to	the	student9s cost	or	use	a	standard	cost	that	you9ve	established	for	all	students	in	that	program.	If	you	establish	standard	cost categories,	you	must	apply	the	cost	allowances	uniformly	to	all	students	in	those	categories.

There	are	a	variety	of	methods	to	arrive	at	average	costs	for	your	students,	such	as	conducting	periodic	surveys	of	your student	population,	assessing	local	housing	costs	or	other	pertinent	data,	or	other	reasonable	methods	you	may	devise which	generate	accurate	average	costs	for	various	categories	of	students.

The	types	of	costs	that	may	be	included	are	the	same	for	all	Title	IV	programs.	For	the	Campus-Based,	TEACH	Grant,	and Direct	Loan	programs,	the	COA,	based	on	the	student9s	enrollment	status,	is	a	student9s	cost	for	the	period	for	which	the aid	is	intended.	For	Pell	Grants,	the	COA	is	always	the	full-year	costs	for	a	full-time	student,	so	you	may	have	to	prorate actual	or	average	costs	up	for	students	who	are	attending	less	than	an	academic	year	(or	who	are	less	than	full	time	in	a term-based	program)	or	prorate	down	for	students	who	are	attending	for	periods	longer	than	an	academic	year.	Note	that though	certain	components	are	excluded	from	the	Pell	Grant	COA	for	a	student	who	is	enrolled	on	a	less-than-half-time basis,	the	components	that	are	included	in	the	less-than-half-time	Pell	Grant	COA	are	still	based	on	the	full-year	costs	for a	full-time	student	for	a	Pell	Grant	recipient	with	an	enrollment	intensity	below	50%.	See	Volume	7	for	guidance	on	Pell Grant	requirements.

The	types	of	costs	included	in	the	COA	are	determined	by	section	472	of	the	HEA	and	are	the	only	costs	that	may	be included	in	a	student9s	COA.	If	a	cost	is	not	listed	below,	it	may	not	be	included	as	part	of	the	COA.

Unless	it	is	specifically	noted	in	the	discussion	of	COA	categories	below	that	a	particular	category	applies	only	to	students who	are	enrolled	at	least	half	time,	the	types	of	expenses	that	may	be	included	in	the	COA	are	the	same	for	all	students, regardless	of	enrollment	status.

This	allowance	is	for	the	tuition	and	fees	normally	assessed	for	a	student	carrying	the	same	academic	workload.	It includes,	for	example,	graduation	fees,	if	incurred	while	the	student	is	still	enrolled	and	when	required	by	the	program and	paid	by	all	students,	and	health	insurance	premiums	that	are	charged	to	all	students.

The	tuition	and	fees	allowance	may	also	include	costs	of	attending	a	required	conference,	but	only	if	these	costs	are included	in	the	standard	cost	of	the	program	for	which	the	conference	is	required.	Including	these	costs	does	not	require exercising	professional	judgment,	as	they	will	be	included	as	a	cost	of	the	program	for	all	students	in	the	program.

See	&lt;Additional	COA	Considerations=	later	in	this	chapter	for	information	on	certain	limitations	that	apply	when determining	what	may	be	included	in	the	tuition	and	fees	component.

Books,	Course	Materials,	Supplies,	and	Equipment

This	includes	all	such	costs	required	of	all	students	in	the	same	program,	including	a	reasonable	allowance	for	the	rental or	upfront	purchase	of	a	personal	computer	that	the	student	will	use	for	study	for	the	enrollment	period,	and	for equipment	needed	for	instruction	by	telecommunications.	The	allowance	for	purchase	of	computer	may	include	costs	for	a computer	purchased	prior	to	the	enrollment	period	(for	example,	a	computer	that	a	student	bought	in	the	summer	for	use in	the	fall	term).

Inclusion	of	Books	and	Supplies	as	Part	of	the	Tuition	and	Fees	COA	Component

If	the	requirements	described	under	&lt;Institutional	Charges=	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	are	met,	the	cost	of	books,	course materials,	equipment,	and	supplies	may	be	included	as	part	of	the	tuition	and	fees	component	of	the	COA.

Students	Must	Be	Able	to	Obtain	Books	and	Supplies	by	the	Seventh	Day	of	the	Payment	Period

If	a	student	could	have	received	a	disbursement	of	Title	IV	funds	10	days	before	the	beginning	of	a	payment	period,	and	if the	disbursement	would	have	created	a	credit	balance	(see	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	for	information	on	early	disbursements and	Title	IV	credit	balances),	then	by	the	seventh	day	of	the	payment	period	a	school	must	provide	a	way	for	eligible students	to	obtain	or	purchase	the	books	and	supplies	for	the	payment	period.	For	more	detail,	see	&lt;Special	provisions	for books	and	supplies=	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2.

Special	Provision	for	Books	and	Supplies

## 34	CFR	668.164(m)

## Transportation

The	transportation	allowance	may	include	costs	incurred	by	a	student	for	transportation	between	school,	residence,	and place	of	work	(including	costs	associated	with	operating	and	maintaining	a	vehicle	used	for	such	transportation),	and other	costs	for	transportation	that	are	required	as	part	of	a	student9s	program	of	study	(for	example,	transportation	to conferences	or	medical	residency	interviews).	However,	the	transportation	allowance	may	not	include	costs	for	the purchase	of	a	vehicle.

Miscellaneous	Personal	Expenses	(Only	for	Students	Enrolled	at	Least	Half	Time)

This	allowance	may	be	included	in	the	COA only	for	students	who	are	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis . Miscellaneous	personal	expenses	may	include	costs	incurred	by	a	student	for	a	prior	learning	assessment	(for	example,	an exam	or	a	portfolio	evaluation).

Living	Expenses	(Food	and	Housing)

Food	and	Housing	Allowance	for	Students	Who	Are	Enrolled	at	Least	Half	Time

For	all	students	who	are	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis,	schools must include	in	their	COA	an	allowance	for	living expenses,	including	food	and	housing	(formerly	known	as	&lt;room	and	board=).	The	food	and	housing	allowance	is	based	on the	student9s	situation,	as	described	below.

- For students	who	choose	institutionally	owned	or	operated	food	services (e.g.,	board	or	meal	plans),	a standard	allowance	that	provides	the	equivalent	of	three	meals	per	day.
- For students	who	do	not	choose	institutionally	owned	or	operated	food	services ,	a	standard	allowance	for purchasing	food	off	campus	that	provides	the	equivalent	of	three	meals	per	day.
- For students	who	reside	in	institutionally	owned	or	operated	housing ,	standard	allowances	(one	for	students with	dependents,	and	one	for	students	without	dependents)	based	on	the	greater	of	the	average	amount	or	the median	amount	assessed	to	such	students	for	housing	charges.

Although	schools	must	use	a	standard	living	expenses	allowance	based	on	the	greater	of	the	average	amount	or	the median	amount	assessed	for	housing	charges,	this	does	not	mean	that	schools	must	develop	the	allowance	based	on a	comparison	of	the	average	and	median	cost	of	all	types	of	institutional	housing	across	the	school.	Since	costs	for different	types	of	institutional	housing	may	vary	widely	(for	example,	double	occupancy	freshmen	dormitories	vs. single	occupancy	graduate	student	housing),	a	school	can	have	different	allowances	based	a	comparison	of	the average	and	median	costs	charged	for	a	specific	housing	type.	For	instance,	if	the	greater	of	the	average	and	median amounts	charged	to	students	living	in	freshmen	dormitories	is	$15,000	per	year,	and	the	greater	of	the	average	and median	amounts	charged	to	students	living	in	graduate	housing	is	$20,000	per	year,	those	amounts	could	be	used	as the	housing	allowances	for	all	students	living	in	each	type	of	institutional	housing.

Because	schools	are	free	to	create	as	many	different	types	of	this	allowance	as	they	choose,	if	the	amounts	charged to	students	for	all	institutional	housing	of	a	specific	type	are	the	same	or	do	not	differ	significantly,	such	an	approach would	likely	result	in	allowances	for	each	housing	type	that	are	equal	or	close	to	the	actual	costs	charged.	Of	course, this	does	not	preclude	a	school	from	using	professional	judgment	on	a	case-by-case	basis	to	include	actual	costs	in the	budget	for	individual	students	whose	costs	for	a	particular	type	of	institutional	housing	differ	significantly	from the	average	or	median	amount	that	would	otherwise	be	used.

- For students	living	off	campus	(not	in	institutionally	owned	or	operated	housing) ,	a	standard	allowance	for rent	or	other	housing	costs.
- For dependent	students	residing	at	home	with	their	parents ,	a	standard	allowance	for	living	expenses determined	by	the	school.	The	living	expenses	allowance	for	these	students	cannot	be	zero.
- For students	living	in	housing	located	on	a	military	base	or	housing	for	which	they	receive	a	military housing	allowance (Basic	Allowance	for	Housing,	or	&lt;BAH=),	a	standard	allowance	for	food	based	on	whether	the student	chooses	to	purchase	food	on-campus	or	off-campus	(as	described	above),	but	not	for	housing	costs.	This applies	to:
- independent	students	who	receive,	or	whose	spouses	receive,	a	BAH	or	who	live	on	a	military	base;	and
- dependent	students	who	are	living	with	parents	who	are	receiving	a	BAH	or	who	live	on	a	military	base.
- For all	other	students ,	an	allowance	based	on	expenses	reasonably	incurred	for	housing	and	food.

Food	and	Housing	Allowance	for	Less-Than-Half-Time	Students

For	less-than-half-time	students,	schools may include	an	allowance	for	food	and	housing	in	the	COA	for	a	limited	period.

For	these	students,	the	COA	may	include	(at	the	option	of	the	school)	a	food	and	housing	allowance	for	up	to	three semesters	or	the	equivalent,	with	no	more	than	two	semesters	or	the	equivalent	being	consecutive	at	any	one	school.	If	a school	chooses	to	include	a	food	and	housing	allowance	in	the	COA	for	less-than-half-time	students,	the	allowance	is based	on	the	student9s	living	situation,	as	described	above	for	students	who	are	enrolled	at	least	half-time.

## Dependent	Care	Costs

For	students	with	dependents,	this	allowance	covers	actual	costs	expected	to	be	incurred	for	dependent	care	during periods	that	include	but	are	not	limited	to	class	time,	study	time,	field	work,	internships,	and	commuting	time	for	the student.	The	amount	of	the	allowance	should	be	based	on	the	number	and	age	of	the	student9s	dependents	and	should not	exceed	reasonable	cost	in	the	community	for	the	type	of	care	provided.	Because	students	are	often	unaware	of	this allowance,	schools	should	explain	the	availability	of	the	dependent	care	allowance	when	counseling	students	and	tell them	how	to	request	that	an	allowance	for	dependent	care	be	included	in	their	COA.

See	&lt;Documentation	of	Exceptional	Expenses=	later	in	the	chapter	for	guidance	on	documenting	dependent	care	costs.

## Costs	of	Obtaining	a	License,	Certification,	or	First	Professional	Credential

For	students	enrolled	in	programs	that	require	professional	licensure,	certification,	or	a	first	professional	credential	in order	to	practice	or	participate	in	the	occupation	the	program	is	preparing	the	student	to	enter,	the	COA	must	include	an allowance	for	the	costs	of	obtaining	the	license,	certification,	or	credential.	Examples	of	allowable	costs	include	fees charged	to	take	a	licensing	exam,	costs	associated	with	applying	for	and	obtaining	the	license	or	certification,	and	bar exam	fees	for	law	students	pursuing	a	Juris	Doctor	(JD)	degree.	Under	this	provision,	the	costs	must	be	incurred	during (not	after)	a	period	of	enrollment,	even	if	the	exam	is	after	the	end	of	the	period.

Schools	may	use	either	actual	or	average	costs	when	determining	the	amount	of	this	allowance.	If	a	school	chooses	to	use average	costs,	it	must	develop	a	reasonable	basis	for	the	average	amount	using	the	actual	costs	of	a	first	professional credential	that	the	school	is	aware	of	for	the	profession	that	a	program	prepares	a	student	to	enter.

The	allowance	may	include	costs	for	multiple	license	or	credential	test	attempts,	though	schools	have	discretion	to	set	a reasonable	limit	on	the	number	of	attempts	allowed	to	be	included	in	a	student9s	COA.

## Costs	for	Study	Abroad	Programs

For	a	student	enrolled	in	a	study	abroad	program	approved	for	credit	by	the	student9s	home	school,	the	COA	includes reasonable	costs	associated	with	such	study	as	determined	by	the	home	school.	For	example,	the	COA	for	a	student	who is	a	U.S.	citizen	studying	at	a	foreign	school	may	include	visa/passport	costs.

## Disability-Related	Expenses

For	a	student	with	a	disability,	the	COA	includes	an	allowance	for	expenses	related	to	the	student9s	disability.	Such expenses	include	special	services,	personal	assistance,	transportation,	equipment,	and	supplies	that	are	reasonably incurred	and	not	provided	by	other	agencies.

A	student	is	considered	to	have	a	disability	if	they	have	a	physical	or	mental	impairment	that	substantially	limits	a	major life	activity,	such	as	if	the	student	is	deaf,	has	a	mental	disability,	is	hard	of	hearing,	has	a	speech	or	language impairment,	is	visually	disabled,	is	seriously	emotionally	disturbed,	orthopedically	impaired,	autistic,	has	a	traumatic	brain injury,	is	otherwise	health-impaired,	or	has	specific	learning	disabilities	that	require	special	education	and	related services.

See	&lt;Documentation	of	Exceptional	Expenses=	later	in	the	chapter	for	guidance	on	documenting	disability-related expenses.

## Cooperative	Education	Program	Employment	Costs

For	students	engaged	in	a	work	experience	through	a	cooperative	education	program,	the	COA	includes	an	allowance	for reasonable	costs	associated	with	such	employment,	as	determined	by	the	school.

## Fees	for	Federal	Student	Loans

For	students	receiving	Direct	Loans	or	loans	under	any	other	federal	student	loan	program,	the	COA	includes	fees	required to	receive	the	loans	(for	example,	the	loan	fee	for	a	Direct	Loan).	Fees	for	non-federal	student	loans	may	not	be	included. You	may	use	either	the	actual	loan	fees	charged	to	the	student	or	an	average	of	fees	charged	to	borrowers	of	the	same type	of	loan	at	your	school.

## COA	for	Correspondence	Students

For	students	engaged	in	correspondence	study,	COA	is	limited	to	tuition	and	fees	and,	if	required,	books,	course materials,	supplies,	and	equipment.	If	the	student	is	fulfilling	a	required	period	of	residential	training,	the	COA	also includes	an	allowance	for	travel,	and	food	and	housing	costs	specifically	incurred	for	the	period	of	residential	training.	As explained	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	1,	a	student	isn9t	eligible	to	receive	Title	IV	aid	for	correspondence	courses	unless	the student	is	enrolled	in	an	associate,	bachelor9s,	or	graduate-degree	program.

## COA	for	Incarcerated	Students

For	confined	or	incarcerated	students,	COA	is	limited	to	tuition	and	fees,	required	books,	course	materials,	supplies,	and equipment,	and	the	cost	of	obtaining	a	license,	certification,	or	first	professional	credential.	Remember	that	an incarcerated	student	is	ineligible	for	Direct	Loans.

## Additional	COA	Considerations

## Periods	of	Non-Attendance

You	may	not	include	in	a	student9s	COA	costs	(if	any)	for	a	period	of	non-attendance.	A	period	of	non-attendance	is	a period	during	which	the	student	is	not	enrolled	and	is	not	otherwise	engaged	in	any	activity	that	is	a	requirement	of	the student9s	program	of	study.	For	example,	if	a	student	does	not	attend	a	module	in	a	term	that	is	divided	into	multiple modules	or	does	not	attend	an	intersession	that	falls	between	two	terms,	you	may	not	include	any	costs	associated	with that	module	or	intersession.	This	applies	even	if	the	module	or	intersession	forms	part	of	a	standard	term	in	which	the student	is	otherwise	enrolled	(see	Chapter	1	of	this	volume	for	more	information	on	the	treatment	of	modules	and intersessions),	or	if	the	student	is	studying	for	a	test	or	coursework	related	to	an	eligible	program	during	the	period	of non-attendance	(though	the	costs	of	such	a	test	itself	may	be	an	allowable	COA	component4see	&lt;Costs	of	Obtaining	a License,	Certification,	or	First	Professional	Credential=	earlier	in	this	chapter).

## Adjustments	for	Special	Circumstances

You	have	the	authority	to	use	professional	judgment	to	adjust	the	COA	on	a	case-by-case	basis	to	allow	for	special circumstances.	Such	adjustments	must	be	documented	in	the	student9s	file.	(See	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	in	Chapter	5	of the	Application	and	Verification	Guide.)

## Limitations	to	Tuition	and	Fees	Component

## Tuition	Discounting

In	establishing	the	tuition	and	fees	component	of	the	COA	for	Title	IV	aid	applicants,	you	must	use	an	amount	that	is required	for	all	students	in	the	same	course	of	study.	Therefore,	a	recipient	of	Title	IV	aid	cannot	be	assessed	charges	that are	higher	than	what	is	charged	to	a	student	not	receiving	aid	under	the	Title	IV	programs.

Offering	a	discount	to	students	who	pay	early	is	not	permitted	because	Title	IV	recipients	may	not	be	able	to	(and	should not	be	required	to)	meet	that	requirement,	and	therefore	students	who	do	not	pay	early	would	effectively	be	assessed	a higher	tuition	amount	than	other	students.	Of	course,	it	would	be	permissible	for	you	to	provide	the	discount	to	all	Title	IV eligible	students	without	regard	to	when	their	charges	are	paid.	However,	doing	so	would	require	an	adjustment	to	such students9	COA.

## Overtime	Charges

Some	schools	may	assess	overtime	charges	for	students	who	fail	to	complete	their	academic	programs	within	the	normal time	frame.	Section	472	of	the	HEA	defines	COA	as	the	tuition	and	fees	normally	assessed	a	student	carrying	the	same academic	workload	required	of	all	students	in	the	same	course	of	study.	Since	overtime	charges	are	not	charges	that	are normally	assessed	(they	are	in	addition	to	normal	tuition	and	fees),	they	may	not	be	included	in	a	student9s	COA	for	Title IV	purposes,	and	therefore	Title	IV	funds	may	not	be	used	to	pay	overtime	charges,	even	if	a	school	obtains	a	student9s	(or parent9s)	authorization	to	do	so.

This	restriction	applies	to	both	clock-hour	and	credit-hour	programs.	For	example,	some	clock-hour	programs	assess &lt;overtime	charges=	for	students	who	don9t	complete	their	programs	within	an	established	timeframe.	Some	credit-hour programs	charge	additional	tuition	or	fees	for	each	course	a	student	takes	if	the	student	fails	to	complete	a	program within	an	established	timeframe.	In	both	cases,	such	charges	may	not	be	counted	in	the	Title	IV	COA,	and	Title	IV	funds may	not	be	used	to	pay	for	the	additional	charges.

## Finance	Charges

You	may	not	use	Title	IV	funds	to	pay	finance	charges	or	fees	that	are	incurred	because	a	student	uses	a	financing method	provided	by	the	school	to	pay	for	educational	expenses	over	time.	Because	students	or	families	choose	to	incur these	additional	expenses	rather	than	paying	the	balance	due	at	registration,	the	additional	charges	are	not	considered educational	expenses,	and	may	not	be	included	in	a	student9s	cost	of	attendance.

As	an	example,	consider	a	school	that	charges	full-time	students	$10,000	per	semester	in	tuition,	payable	either	at registration,	or,	under	an	optional	payment	plan,	in	four	payments	of	$2,600	each	over	the	course	of	the	semester,	for	a total	of	$10,400.	The	school	may	offer	the	optional	payment	plan	but	can9t	use	Title	IV	funds	to	pay	for	the	$400	in additional	costs	incurred	by	students	or	families	who	opt	to	use	the	plan.

## Test	Prep	Class	Costs

You	may	not	include	the	costs	of	a	test	prep	class	that	is	not	part	of	a	student's	eligible	program	in	the	student9s	COA.

Prohibitions	on	Charging	Fees	and	Penalties

## You	may	not4

- Request	from	or	charge	any	student	a	fee	for	processing	or	handling	any	application,	form,	or	data	required	to determine	eligibility	for,	and	amount	of,	Title	IV	HEA	program	assistance;	or
- Impose	any	penalty	on	a	student	because	of	a	student9s	inability	to	meet	their	financial	obligations	to	the	school	as	a result	of	the	delayed	disbursement	of	the	proceeds	of	a	Title	IV	loan	due	to	compliance	with	Title	IV	requirements,	or delays	attributable	to	your	school.

If	you	hire	a	transcription	or	diploma	evaluation	service	to	aid	in	the	process	of	determining	student	eligibility,	the	cost	of evaluating	a	foreign	credential	must	be	incurred	as	a	charge	of	admission	prior	to	a	student's	enrollment	in	an	eligible program	and	thus	cannot	be	included	in	the	student9s	COA.	For	more	detail	on	checking	foreign	diplomas,	see	Volume	1, Chapter	1.

## Documentation	of	Exceptional	Expenses

The	law	doesn9t	specify	what	documentation	you	must	collect	for	expenses	such	as	dependent	care	or	disability-related expenses.	You	can	document	these	expenses	in	any	reasonable	way,	such	as	documenting	an	interview	with	the	student or	obtaining	a	written	statement	from	the	student	or	other	appropriate	sources.

## NCAA	Considerations

The	&lt;Power	Five=	conferences	(The	ACC,	Big	Ten,	Big	12,	Pac	12,	and	SEC)	of	the	National	Collegiate	Athletic	Association

(NCAA)	have	voted	to	expand	their	athletic	scholarships	to	cover	the	full	COA	for	athletes.	Previously,	only	the components	listed	under	&lt;Allowable	Costs	in	General=	in	this	chapter	were	included	in	COA.	This	change	only	applies	to the	schools	in	the	Power	Five	but	it	may	be	adopted	by	other	schools	participating	in	Division	I	athletics	at	their	discretion.

One	exception	to	the	full	cost	COA	is	the	practice	of	a	school9s	paying	the	costs	of	an	athlete9s	insurance	against	injury	to protect	against	loss	of	future	income.	This	expense	may	not	be	included	in	COA	(because	it	is	not	related	to	a	student9s educational	program),	but	it	is	included	as	other	financial	assistance	(OFA)	for	the	student	in	the	aid	packaging	process. For	packaging	guidance,	see	Chapter	3	of	this	volume.

Exclusion	of	State	Aid	From	COA	and	OFA

If	the	source	of	assistance	is	a	state	and	is	designated	by	the	state	to	offset	a	specific	component	of	the	student9s	COA, the	amount	of	that	assistance	may	be	excluded	from	both	COA	and	OFA.	You	may	exclude	such	assistance	on	a	studentby-student	basis,	but	if	it	is	excluded,	it	must	be	excluded	for	both	COA	and	OFA.	If	the	amount	excluded	is	less	than	the allowance	provided	in	the	student9s	COA,	you	must	exclude	the	lesser	amount.

Costs	for	Programs	That	Become	Eligible	in	the	Middle	of	a	Year

When	awarding	aid	from	programs	other	than	the	Direct	Loan	Program,	you	may	not	count	toward	the	student9s	COA	any costs	incurred	in	any	payment	period	prior	to	the	payment	period	during	which	the	program	gained	Title	IV	eligibility. When	awarding	aid	from	the	Direct	Loan	Program,	you	may	not	count	any	costs	incurred	in	periods	of	enrollment	(loan periods)	prior	to	the	period	of	enrollment	during	which	the	program	gained	eligibility.	This	means,	for	example,	that	if	a program	becomes	eligible	in	the	spring	semester	of	a	fall-spring	academic	year,	you	can	only	include	costs	incurred	in	the spring	semester	when	awarding	aid	from	programs	other	than	the	Direct	Loan	Program.	However,	if	you	originate	a	Direct Loan	for	a	loan	period	covering	the	full	academic	year,	you	can	include	costs	incurred	during	both	the	fall	and	spring semesters	when	determining	the	amount	of	the	loan.

You	may	also	not	include	any	costs	incurred	in	payment	periods	(for	non-loan	programs)	or	periods	of	enrollment	(for Direct	Loans)	that	the	student	has	already	completed.	For	more	details	on	how	programs	gain	Title	IV	eligibility,	see Volume	2,	Chapter	5	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

Changes	in	Pell	Grant	COA

For	guidance	on	when	changes	in	the	Pell	Grant	COA	require	you	to	recalculate	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	award,	see	Volume 7,	Chapter	7.

Costs	Waived	or	Paid	by	Other	Sources

When	a	specific	component	of	a	student9s	COA	is	waived	or	explicitly	paid	by	another	source,	special	treatment	may	be necessary.	In	some	situations,	the	student	is	assessed	the	normal	tuition	and	fees	charge	with	an	offsetting	credit	issued. In	other	situations,	the	student	is	never	charged	tuition	and	fees	at	all.	Although	this	section	discusses	this	concept	in terms	of	tuition	and	fee	charges,	it	applies	to	any	of	the	components	of	a	student9s	COA.

In	some	cases,	such	as	under	Workforce	Innovation	and	Opportunity	Act	(WIOA)	programs,	a	student9s	tuition	and	fees	are paid	by	another	organization	or	are	waived.	The	student9s	costs	are	based	on	what	the	school	is	actually	charging	the student,	as	specified	in	the	agreement	between	the	school	and	the	student.

If	the	student	is	charged	for	the	tuition	and	fees,	even	if	the	charge	is	eventually	paid	by	someone	other	than	the	student (e.g.,	a	scholarship	agency	or	other	source	of	aid),	then	that	tuition	and	fee	amount	is	included	in	the	COA	in	most circumstances.	The	tuition	and	fees	payment	would	then	be	counted	as	OFA.	The	charge	is	documented	in	the	same	way as	for	any	non-WIOA	student	(for	instance,	in	your	school9s	contract	with	the	student	or	in	the	agreement	with	the	WIOA agency).	If	your	school	charges	the	student	for	tuition	and	fees,	your	school	would	have	to	expect	the	student	to	pay	the charge	if	the	WIOA	agency	or	other	source	of	assistance	doesn9t	pay	on	the	student9s	behalf.

If	the	student	is	never	charged	for	tuition	and	fees,	then	the	COA	wouldn9t	include	the	tuition	and	fees	component.	Some WIOA	agreements	with	schools	provide	that	the	school	can9t	charge	the	tuition	and	fees	to	the	student,	even	if	WIOA doesn9t	cover	the	costs.	If	your	school	is	prohibited	under	such	an	agreement	from	charging	tuition	and	fees	to	the student,	then	the	tuition	and	fees	aren9t	included	in	the	student9s	COA,	and,	therefore,	that	amount	would	not	be	included as	OFA.

Even	if	there9s	no	tuition	and	fees	component,	the	student9s	budget	still	includes	the	other	costs	listed	previously,	such	as an	allowance	for	living	expenses.	The	option	to	either	include	the	cost	and	aid	in	both	COA	and	OFA	versus	excluding	both from	COA	and	OFA	only	applies	to	non-federal	sources	of	assistance,	and	only	when	that	assistance	is	designated	to	offset specific	components	of	COA	(e.g.,	tuition,	housing,	and	food).

## WIOA	Reimbursement	Contracts

Some	WIOA	contracts	operate	on	a	reimbursement	basis;	that	is,	the	student	must	fulfill	the	terms	of	the	contract	before WIOA	will	reimburse	the	school	for	tuition	and	fee	costs.	If	the	student	doesn9t	fulfill	the	terms	of	the	contract,	the	school is	left	with	an	unpaid	tuition	and	fees	charge.	The	school	isn9t	permitted	to	hold	the	student	liable	for	the	unpaid	tuition and	fees.	Contracts	are	established	this	way	to	offer	schools	an	incentive	to	properly	train	and	place	students	enrolled	in the	training	programs.	However,	if	a	tuition	and	fees	charge	is	included	in	a	Title	IV	aid	recipient9s	budget,	the	student would	be	liable	for	any	outstanding	charges	that	are	not	reimbursed	by	WIOA.	Therefore,	schools	that	enter	into reimbursement	contracts	must	remove	the	tuition	and	fees	component	from	the	Title	IV	budget	because,	under	these contracts,	schools	are	prohibited	from	holding	the	student	liable	for	outstanding	charges.

## Effects	of	Waivers	on	COA

If	your	school	treats	a	waiver	as	a	payment	of	tuition	and	fees	that	have	been	charged	to	a	student,	then	the	waiver	is considered	OFA	and	the	full	amount	of	the	tuition	and	fees	are	included	in	a	student9s	COA.

On	the	other	hand,	if	the	student	is	never	assessed	the	full	charges,	the	waiver	is	not	considered	to	be	financial	aid,	and only	the	charges	actually	assessed	the	student	would	be	included	in	the	student9s	COA.

Volume	3,	Chapter	2,	Example	1:	Housing	and	Food	Waiver

A	school	saves	some	of	its	resident	assistant	jobs	for	students	with	exceptional	financial	need.	All	resident assistants	receive	a	waiver	of	housing	and	food	charges.	If	a	student	who	is	employed	as	a	resident	assistant quits	the	job,	the	waiver	is	removed,	and	the	student	must	pay	the	housing	and	food	charges.	All	students	at	the school	have	housing	and	food	charges	in	their	COA.	For	students	who	are	resident	assistants	because	of	their financial	need,	the	school	must	count	the	housing	and	food	waiver	as	OFA.	The	waiver	would	not	be	counted	as untaxed	income,	but	if	included	in	the	student9s	adjusted	gross	income	(AGI),	such	a	waiver	would	be	reported	on the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA®)	form	as	&lt;grant	and	scholarship	aid	reported	to	the	IRS=	and would	be	excluded	from	total	income	in	the	SAI	formula.

## Volume	3,	Chapter	2,	Example	2:	In-State	Tuition	Voucher

A	school	charges	all	full-time	students	the	same	tuition	charge.	However,	in-state	students	receive	a	voucher	to cover	the	difference	between	what	most	states	consider	in-state	versus	out-of-state	tuition.	The	school	has	two options:

- The	first	option	would	be	to	include	the	same	tuition	charge	in	the	full-time	COA	for	all	students	and	include the	amount	of	the	voucher	as	OFA	in	the	financial	aid	packages	for	in-state	students.
- The	second	option	would	be	to	exclude	the	amount	of	the	voucher	from	both	COA	and	OFA	because	the voucher	must	be	used	to	explicitly	pay	a	specific	component	of	the	COA.

Regardless	of	the	option	the	school	chooses,	it	must	apply	the	option	consistently.

## COA	for	a	Distance	Education	Student

The	law	prohibits	you	from	making	a	distinction	based	on	the	mode	of	instruction	when	determining	the	COA	for	a	student receiving	all	or	part	of	their	instruction	through	distance	education.	However,	you	have	the	authority	to	use	professional judgment	to	adjust	the	COA	on	a	case-by-case	basis	to	allow	for	special	circumstances.	For	example,	you	may	exclude transportation	costs	if	you	determine	that	such	costs	will	not	be	incurred	by	a	student.	Such	adjustments	must	be documented	in	the	student9s	file.	See	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	in	Chapter	5	of	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide	for further	guidance.

## Costs	for	Full	Program	Charged	at	Start

A	school	may	charge	the	total	tuition	cost	for	a	program	at	the	beginning	of	the	first	period	of	enrollment.	If	the	program is	longer	than	an	academic	year,	for	Direct	Loans	and	Campus-Based	aid	the	tuition	costs	apply	only	to	the	first	period	of enrollment.	For	example,	if	a	school	charges	the	entire	$10,000	tuition	cost	for	a	program	up	front,	the	$10,000	will	be included	in	the	first	academic	year9s	COA	when	packaging	Direct	Loans	and	Campus-Based	aid	but	would	not	be	included in	the	second	academic	year9s	COA	components.	For	Pell	Grants,	you	must	prorate	these	charges	to	reflect	the	academic year	in	accordance	with	the	procedures	outlined	in	Volume	7.

See	also	the	example	of	apportioning	costs	that	are	charged	up	front	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook. However,	it9s	important	to	understand	that	the	example	in	Volume	4	illustrates	prorating	total	costs	that	are	charged	up front	for	purposes	of	determining	the	amount	of	aid	that	may	be	credited	to	a	student's	account	and	the	amount	that must	be	paid	to	the	student	as	a	credit	balance.	This	is	a	separate	issue	from	the	determination	of	the	COA	that	would	be used	in	calculating	the	specific	aid	amounts	that	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive.

Campus-Based,	TEACH	Grant,	and	Direct	Loan	Programs:	Costs	Based	on	Actual	Period	of	Enrollment

As	explained	earlier	in	this	chapter,	the	COA	for	Pell	Grants	is	always	based	on	the	full-year	costs	for	a	full-time	student (see	Volume	7	for	more	information).	In	contrast,	the	COA	used	to	package	Campus-Based	aid,	TEACH	Grants,	and	Direct Loans	is	for	the	student9s	actual	period	of	enrollment.	Therefore,	if	the	period	of	enrollment	for	which	a	student9s	aid	is intended	is	longer	than	the	9-month	academic	year	for	which	costs	are	normally	determined,	you	must	use	a	higher	COA that	includes	living	expenses,	such	as	food	and	housing,	for	the	longer	period	of	time.	If	the	student	will	be	attending	for less	than	nine	months,	you	must	use	a	lower	COA.	You	can	choose	to	prorate	the	allowances	you	use	for	nine	months,	or you	can	calculate	the	cost	in	any	other	reasonable	way.

As	an	example,	if	a	student	is	completing	a	program	of	study	by	taking	a	half-time	course	load	for	the	fall	semester	at your	school,	and	that9s	the	only	term	that	the	student	will	be	attending	in	the	award	year,	you	could	use	the	actual	tuition and	fee	charges	for	the	student9s	costs.	If	you	use	average	costs	for	living	expenses	for	a	9-month	academic	year	for students	in	that	program,	you	may	divide	your	average	costs	by	the	number	of	terms	in	the	academic	year	to	find	the cost	for	this	enrollment	period	(assuming	the	terms	are	substantially	equal	in	length).

Important: When	calculating	COA	for	periods	other	than	nine	months,	you	must	still	use	the	calculated	9-month SAI.	There	are	no	alternate	SAIs	comparable	to	the	alternate	Expected	Family	Contributions	(EFCs)	that	were	used prior	to	the	2024-2025	award	year	for	periods	other	than	nine	months.	See	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide and	Chapter	3	of	this	volume	for	more	information.

## Chapter	3 Packaging	Aid

In	this	chapter	we	explain	how	to	package	a	student9s	aid	once	you9ve	received	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	information, including	the	student	aid	index	(SAI),	and	have	calculated	the	student9s	aid	eligibility.	The	general	rule	in	packaging	is that	the	student9s	need-based	aid	must	not	exceed	the	student9s	financial	need,	and	total	financial	aid	and	other	financial assistance	(OFA)	must	not	exceed	the	student9s	cost	of	attendance	(COA).	If	you	discover	that	a	student9s	aid	package exceeds	the	student9s	financial	need	or	COA,	you	must	attempt	to	adjust	the	aid	package	to	eliminate	the	overaward.	See Volume	4,	Chapter	3	for	guidance	on	handling	overawards	and	overpayments.

## Packaging	Overview

For	some	Title	IV	programs,	eligibility	is	limited	to	students	who	have	financial	need.	Students	are	considered	to	have financial	need	if	their	COA	exceeds	their	SAI.	These	&lt;need-based=	programs	include	the	Federal	Pell	Grant,	Federal Supplemental	Educational	Opportunity	Grant	(FSEOG),	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS),	and	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	programs. The	total	aid	that	a	student	receives	from	need-based	programs	may	not	exceed	the	student9s	financial	need.	Pell	Grants are	the	first	source	of	aid	for	students	with	financial	need.	A	student9s	eligibility	for	aid	from	the	other	need-based programs	is	then	determined	by	subtracting	the	student9s	SAI	and	OFA	(including	the	student9s	Pell	Grant)	from	the	COA (see	&lt;Treatment	of	Negative	SAIs=	later	in	the	chapter	for	guidance	on	packaging	need-based	aid	for	students	with negative	SAIs):

COA	3	SAI	3	OFA	=	remaining	need

For	other	Title	IV	programs,	eligibility	is	not	based	on	the	student9s	financial	need.	These	&lt;non-need-based=	programs include	the	Teacher	Education	Assistance	for	College	and	Higher	Education	(TEACH)	Grant,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	and Direct	PLUS	Loan	programs.	A	student9s	eligibility	for	non-need-based	aid	is	determined	by	subtracting	OFA	(including	any need-based	aid)	from	the	COA:

COA	3	OFA	=	eligibility	for	non-need-based	aid

As	explained	later	in	this	chapter,	non-need-based	aid	may	be	used	to	replace	the	SAI.

Depending	on	individual	circumstances,	students	may	receive	only	need-based	aid,	only	non-need-based	aid,	or	a combination	of	both	types	of	aid.	In	general,	the	total	amount	of	need-based	aid	cannot	exceed	the	student9s	financial need	and	the	total	amount	of	all	aid	cannot	exceed	the	student9s	COA.	However,	there	are	some	exceptions	to	the	normal packaging	process	under	certain	circumstances	or	for	certain	Title	IV	programs,	as	we	explain	later	in	this	chapter.

The	COA	for	the	Campus-Based,	TEACH	Grant,	and	Direct	Loan	programs	is	based	on	the	student9s	enrollment	status	and costs	for	the	period	for	which	the	aid	is	intended.	The	COA	used	for	the	Pell	Grant	Program	is	always	the	full-year	costs	for a	full-time	student,	so	you	may	have	to	prorate	actual	or	average	costs	up	for	students	who	are	attending	less	than	an academic	year	(or	who	are	part-time	in	a	term-based	program)	or	prorate	down	for	students	who	are	attending	for	periods longer	than	an	academic	year	(see	Volume	7	for	more	information).

The	process	of	awarding	aid	without	exceeding	the	student9s	financial	need	(for	need-based	aid)	or	COA	(for	total	aid received)	is	traditionally	called	packaging.	Packaging	is	a	process	that	varies	from	school	to	school,	depending	on	the types	of	scholarship	and	other	aid	available	at	the	school,	and	the	characteristics	of	the	student	population.	Schools	may have	different	packaging	philosophies,	but	they	generally	try	to	find	the	best	combination	of	aid	to	meet	the	financial need	of	their	students.

To	help	you	package	federal	student	aid	with	your	other	aid	awards,	EDExpress	includes	a	packaging	module.	You	can enter	information	about	your	school9s	student	aid	programs	and	set	up	factors	to	be	considered	in	packaging,	and	then use	the	software	to	automate	the	packaging	process.	Most	schools	use	some	form	of	packaging	software,	whether EDExpress	or	software	from	a	commercial	vendor.	You	are	not	required	to	use	EDExpress	to	package	Title	IV	awards,	and you	do	not	have	to	report	the	student9s	aid	package	to	the	Common	Origination	and	Disbursement	(COD)	system.

Prior	to	the	2024-2025	award	year,	the	HEA	allowed	schools	to	use	alternate	expected	family	contributions	(EFCs)	when packaging	aid	for	periods	other	than	nine	months.	The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	eliminated	this	provision.	Beginning	with the	2024-2025	award	year,	when	packaging	aid	for	any	period	that	is	not	nine	months,	schools	must	use	a	student9s calculated	9-month	SAI	in	the	formula	to	determine	eligibility	for	need-based	aid,	as	described	above	(that	is,	COA	3	SAI	3 OFA	=	need).	As	a	result	of	this	change,	students	who	are	enrolled	for	periods	shorter	than	nine	months	will	have	less financial	need	than	would	have	been	the	case	in	the	past	when	using	an	alternate	(smaller)	EFC	for	such	periods.	See Volume	8,	Chapter	3	for	more	information	on	how	this	change	may	affect	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility	for	students receiving	loans	for	periods	of	enrollment	(loan	periods)	shorter	than	nine	months.

## Treatment	of	Negative	SAIs

A	student	may	have	a	calculated	SAI	that	is	a	negative	number	as	low	as	-1,500.	Also,	as	explained	in	Chapter	3	of	the Application	and	Verification	Guide,	certain	students	will	automatically	receive	a	-1,500	SAI.	When	packaging	need-based aid	for	students	with	negative	SAIs,	schools	must	convert	any	negative	SAIs	to	zero	for	awarding	purposes.	This	means that	a	negative	SAI	will	not	increase	the	amount	of	need-based	aid	a	student	can	receive.	Note	that	a	negative	SAI	also does	not	increase	the	amount	of	non-need-based	aid	that	a	student	may	receive	because	the	SAI	is	not	a	factor	in determining	eligibility	for	aid	that	isn9t	based	on	financial	need.

## Packaging	Rules

## Pell	Grants	as	the	First	Source	of	Aid

Pell	Grants	are	the	first	source	of	aid	for	a	student,	and	packaging	Title	IV	funds	begins	with	determining	a	student9s	Pell Grant	eligibility,	as	described	in	Volume	7.	A	correctly	determined	Pell	Grant	is	never	adjusted	to	take	into	account	other forms	of	aid.	When	awarding	aid	from	the	other	Title	IV	programs,	you	must	ensure	that	the	student9s	need	or	COA	is	not exceeded.

In	some	cases,	a	student9s	aid	package	may	include	a	Pell	Grant	and	non-Title	IV	aid	(for	example,	institutional	aid	or private	education	loans),	but	no	other	types	of	Title	IV	aid,	and	the	combination	of	the	Pell	Grant	and	the	other	aid	may	be large	enough	to	exceed	the	student9s	COA.	For	instance,	the	National	Collegiate	Athletic	Association9s	(NCAA's)	rules	for athletic	aid	may	permit	a	school	to	award	athletic	aid	that	covers	a	student9s	full	COA	(see	&lt;NCAA	Considerations=	in Chapter	2	of	this	volume	for	more	information).	In	this	case,	the	student	is	still	eligible	for	the	full	amount	of	the	Pell Grant.	However,	you	can9t	award	any	Title	IV	funds	other	than	the	Pell	Grant.

Note	that	in	some	cases	a	student9s	SAI	may	be	higher	than	the	COA,	resulting	in	no	financial	need,	but	the	student	may still	qualify	for	a	calculated	Pell	Grant	or	a	minimum	Pell	Grant	(see	Volume	7,	Chapter	2	for	more	information	on	Pell Grant	eligibility	criteria).	As	an	example,	consider	a	student	with	an	SAI	of	6,650,	a	COA	of	$5,500,	and	a	calculated	Pell Grant	amount	of	$745.	In	this	circumstance	the	student	is	still	eligible	for	the	full	Pell	Grant	amount	(as	long	as	it	doesn9t exceed	the	COA),	but	you	may	not	award	any	other	types	of	need-based	Title	IV	aid.

If	a	student9s	aid	package	includes	a	Pell	Grant,	other	types	of	Title	IV	aid,	and	non-Title	IV	aid,	and	the	total	aid	amount exceeds	the	student9s	COA,	the	student	still	qualifies	for	the	full	Pell	Grant	amount,	but	you	must	adjust	the	other	Title	IV aid	to	ensure	that	the	COA	is	not	exceeded.

In	the	circumstances	described	above	you	may	(but	are	not	required	to)	adjust	non-Title	IV	aid	over	which	you	have control	in	accordance	with	your	school9s	policies.

Before	awarding	a	Pell	Grant,	you	must	check	the	COD	common	record	or	COD	website	to	make	sure	students	close	to	the 600%	Pell	Grant	lifetime	limit	are	not	packaged	in	such	a	way	as	to	exceed	600%	of	the	LEU;	to	do	so	would	be	to overaward	the	student.	The	Department	will	also	provide	weekly	reports	in	the	SAIG	mailbox	(message	class	PGLEXXOP, where	XX=year)	for	your	school9s	Pell-eligible	students	that	have	a	Pell	LEU	greater	than	or	equal	to	450%.	See	Volume	7, Chapter	8	for	more	detail	on	the	effects	of	various	levels	of	Pell	Grant	LEU.

## Considering	Grants	and	Subsidized	Loans	First

The	law	requires	aid	administrators	to	determine	whether	a	student	is	eligible	for	aid	from	certain	other	Title	IV	programs that	would	reduce	the	need	for	borrowing.	If	your	school	participates	in	the	Federal	Pell	Grant	Program,	you	must	include the	student9s	estimated	Pell	Grant	eligibility	as	OFA	when	making	Campus-Based	awards,	whether	or	not	the	student	has received	the	Pell	Grant	at	the	time	you	make	your	Campus-Based	award.

Similarly,	you	must	determine	an	undergraduate	student9s	Pell	Grant	eligibility	before	originating	a	Direct	Subsidized	or Unsubsidized	Loan	for	that	student,	and	you	must	package	Campus-Based	funds	and	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	before Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.	In	addition,	you	must	determine	an	undergraduate	student9s	maximum	Direct	Subsidized	Loan eligibility	before	originating	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	the	student	(see	Volume	8,	Chapter	1	for	an	explanation	of	the difference	between	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans).	However,	if	a	student	has	received	a determination	of	need	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	that	is	$200	or	less,	you	have	the	option	of	including	that	amount	as part	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	and	are	not	required	to	originate	a	separate	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	for	the	student.

For	a	dependent	student,	you	may	originate	and	disburse	a	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	without	determining	the	student9s Pell	Grant	and	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility.	However,	if	the	student	on	whose	behalf	the	parent	is	borrowing	receives Pell	Grant	funds	and/or	other	types	of	aid	for	the	same	period	of	enrollment,	that	other	aid	must	be	considered	when determining	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	amount	that	the	parent	is	eligible	to	borrow.	The	amount	of	a	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan cannot	exceed	the	student9s	COA	minus	other	financial	assistance	that	the	student	has	received.

Determining	Pell	Grant	eligibility	is	not	relevant	when	awarding	Direct	PLUS	Loans	to	graduate	or	professional	students, but	you	must	determine	a	graduate	or	professional	student9s	maximum	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	eligibility	before	you originate	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	the	student.

Requirement	to	Consider	Federal	Pell	Grants	First

## 34	CFR	685.200(a)(1)(iii)

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	1:	Basic	Packaging

A	dependent	second-year	undergraduate	student	has	a	COA	of	$12,500	and	an	SAI	of	2,500	for	the	current	year. The	SAI	is	subtracted	from	the	COA,	leaving	the	student	with	$10,000	in	unmet	need:

$12,500	COA

- -	2,500	SAI

$10,000	need

The	aid	administrator	begins	by	awarding	a	Pell	Grant	and	applying	an	outside	scholarship	before	awarding Campus-Based	aid.	The	student9s	OFA	is	a	$5,500	Pell	Grant	and	a	$400	outside	scholarship:

$12,500	COA

- -	2,500	SAI

- -	5,500	Pell	Grant*

- -	400	Scholarship

## $4,100	remaining	need

*The	$5,500	Pell	Grant	amount	shown	in	this	example	is	for	illustrative	purposes	only	and	is	not	intended	to represent	the	actual	Pell	Grant	amount	that	a	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive.	See	Volume	7	for	guidance	on the	determination	of	Pell	Grant	awards.

Subtracting	the	SAI	and	OFA	from	the	COA	leaves	$4,100	in	remaining	need.	The	student	has	sufficient	need	for the	maximum	awards	that	the	aid	administrator	can	make	under	the	school's	policy	for	Campus-Based	funds: $800	FSEOG,	and	$1,800	in	FWS	employment:

## $12,500	COA

- -	2,500	SAI

- -	5,500	Pell	Grant

- -	400	Scholarship

- -	800	FSEOG

- -	1800	FWS

## $1,500	remaining	need

The	aid	administrator	finishes	the	packaging	process	by	awarding	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	in	the	amount	of $1,500	to	fully	meet	the	student9s	financial	need.	As	a	dependent	second-year	student,	the	student9s	combined Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	limit	is	$6,500	(maximum	of	$4,500	subsidized).	The financial	aid	package	now	fully	covers	the	student9s	financial	need	of	$10,000.	However,	the	student	could	also receive	up	to	$2,500	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	to	replace	the	SAI	and	completely	cover	the	COA.

## $12,500	COA

- -	5,500	Pell	Grant

- -	400	scholarship

- -	800	FSEOG

- -	1,800	FWS

- -	1,500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan

- -	$2,500	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan

## $0	remaining	need

As	noted	earlier	in	the	chapter	a	negative	SAI	is	converted	to	zero	for	packaging	purposes.	For	instance,	if	a student	with	$15,000	COA	and	a	-500	SAI	receives	a	$7,500*	Pell	Grant,	remaining	need	for	other	need-based programs	will	be	$7,500:

- $15,000

- -	0

- -	$7,500

$7,500	remaining	need

*Note: The	$7,500	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	is	a	fictitious	amount	used	for	illustrative	purposes	only.	It	is	not intended	to	represent	the	actual	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	for	any	particular	award	year.

## Campus-Based	Aid

You	should	consider	several	things	when	developing	a	packaging	policy.	For	instance,	some	schools	give	more	grant assistance	to	beginning	students,	who	may	have	more	difficulty	adjusting	to	campus	life,	increasing	the	proportion	of loans	and	work-study	in	subsequent	years.	For	the	Campus-Based	Programs	and	other	programs	where	the	available funds	may	not	be	sufficient	to	meet	every	eligible	student9s	need,	some	schools	decide	to	give	a	higher	proportion	of	aid to	the	neediest	students.	Other	schools	award	funds	as	an	equal	proportion	of	each	student9s	need.

Many	schools	use	software,	such	as	the	Packaging	module	in	EDExpress,	that	can	be	configured	to	implement	the	school9s packaging	philosophy.	For	instance,	EDExpress	allows	you	to	specify	the	order	in	which	aid	sources	are	to	be	applied	to the	student9s	unmet	need,	and	to	set	overall	percentage	limits	on	the	amount	of	gift	(grants	and	scholarships)	and	selfhelp	aid	that	will	be	included	in	the	aid	package.

## Use	Net	FWS	Earnings	When	Packaging

To	determine	the	net	amount	of	a	student9s	FWS	earnings	that	will	be	available	to	help	pay	for	the	student9s	costs,	you must	subtract	estimated	taxes	and	job-related	costs	from	the	student9s	gross	FWS	earnings	(see	Volume	6,	Chapter	2).

## FSEOG	and	Pell	Grant	LEU

A	student	who	receives	a	Pell	Grant	at	any	time	in	the	award	year	may	be	awarded	an	FSEOG	for	that	award	year;	the student	does	not	have	to	receive	a	Pell	Grant	in	the	same	payment	period	as	the	FSEOG.	For	example,	in	the	case	of	a student	who	receives	a	Pell	Grant	only	for	the	fall	semester	due	to	reaching	their	lifetime	eligibility	used	(LEU),	the student	may	be	awarded	an	FSEOG	for	both	the	fall	semester	and	subsequent	spring	semester.

Students	who	have	reached	or	exceeded	600%	of	their	Pell	Grant	LEU	may	still	be	eligible	to	receive	FSEOG.	However, they	must	be	considered	in	the	second	selection	group	(see	&lt;Selecting	FSEOG	recipients=	in	Volume	6,	Chapter	6).

You	must	keep	documentation	of	the	eligible	SAI	that	was	calculated	for	the	student,	and	you	must	confirm	Pell	Grant eligibility	prior	to	disbursement	of	the	FSEOG.	For	more	details	on	Pell	Grant	LEU,	see	Volume	7,	Chapter	8.

## Packaging	TEACH	Grants

TEACH	Grants	are	not	considered	to	be	need-based	aid.	The	amount	of	a	student9s	TEACH	Grant,	in	combination	with	the student9s	OFA	from	all	other	Title	IV	programs,	may	not	exceed	the	COA.	You	may	optionally	use	a	TEACH	Grant	to	replace the	SAI	(see	the	&lt;Substituting	for	the	SAI=	section	later	in	this	chapter).

## Direct	Loan	Packaging	Considerations

- Before	you	originate	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	an	undergraduate	student,	you	must determine	the	student9s	eligibility	for	a	Pell	Grant.
- Before	you	originate	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	an	undergraduate	student,	you	must	determine	the	student9s maximum	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility.
- You	may	originate	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	only	for	the	amount	of	the	student9s	financial	need	(that	is,	the	student9s COA	minus	the	student9s	SAI	and	OFA).
- A	student	may	qualify	for	a	combination	of	both	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.
- The	parent	of	a	dependent	student	can	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	to	pay	for	the	student9s	COA	(assuming	that	the parent	meets	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility	requirements).	There	is	no	fixed	loan	limit	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans,	but Direct	PLUS	Loans	cannot	be	made	for	an	amount	that	exceeds	the	student's	COA,	less	other	financial	aid	received.
- If	the	student	is	independent,	or	if	a	dependent	student9s	parent	is	ineligible	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	the	student	is eligible	for	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	amounts.
- Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	and	Direct	PLUS	Loans	can	be	used	to	replace	the	SAI,	as	well	as	to	cover	the	student9s unmet	need.
- Direct	Subsidized	Loans	are	available	only	to	undergraduate	students.
- Direct	PLUS	Loans	are	available	to	parents	of	dependent	undergraduate	students	and	to	graduate	and	professional students.	Note	that	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	does	not	count	against	a	graduate/professional	student9s	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits.
- You	may	not	limit	Direct	Loan	borrowing	by	students	or	parents	on	an	across-the-board	or	categorical	basis	(for	more information,	see	&lt;Refusing	to	Originate	a	Loan	or	Originating	for	Less	Than	Maximum	Eligibility=	in	Volume	8,	Chapter 1).

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	2:	Graduate/Professional	PLUS	Packaging

A	student	enrolls	in	a	graduate-level	program	with	a	total	COA	of	$31,000.	The	student	has	an	annual	loan	limit	of $20,500	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	and	is	also	eligible	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans.

Eligibility	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	is	determined	by	subtracting	OFA	from	the	COA.	The	SAI	is	not	taken	into consideration.	The	student	has	already	been	awarded	a	graduate	scholarship	of	$5,000.	Subtracting	this	OFA	from the	COA	leaves	$26,000	in	unmet	costs	that	the	school	partially	covers	by	awarding	the	student	a	$20,500	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan.	The	student	now	has	$5,500	in	remaining	costs.

$31,000	COA

- -	5,000	scholarship

- -	20,500	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan

$5,500	remaining	costs

As	with	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	eligibility	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans	is	determined	by	subtracting	OFA	from	the COA.	Subtracting	the	scholarship	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	from	the	COA	allows	the	student	to	receive	a Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	$5,500	to	fully	cover	the	COA.

Packaging	When	a	Student	Chooses	Not	To	Borrow	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans

If	a	graduate	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrower	has	not	requested	the	maximum	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	for	which	they are	eligible,	you	must:

- Notify	the	borrower	of	their	maximum	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	eligibility;
- Provide	the	borrower	with	a	comparison	of	the	maximum	interest	rates	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	and	Direct PLUS	Loans;
- Explain	when	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	enters	repayment	and	when	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	enters	repayment;	and
- Give	the	borrower	the	opportunity	to	request	the	maximum	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	which	they	are	eligible.

If	a	dependent	student	for	whom	a	parent	is	borrowing	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	chooses	not	to	apply	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	or Unsubsidized	Loan,	the	Direct	Subsidized/Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	that	the	student	would	have	been	eligible	to	receive is not counted	as	OFA	when	determining	the	amount	of	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	The	same	principle	applies	when	a graduate	or	professional	student	is	eligible	for	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	but	chooses	to	borrow	only	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

Packaging	Aid	for	Certain	Dependents	of	Deceased	Servicemembers	or	Public	Safety	Officers	(Pell	Grant	Special	Rule)

The	Special	Rule	in	Section	401(c)	of	the	HEA	allows	certain	students	whose	parents	or	guardians	died	while	serving	on active	duty	in	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	or	while	serving	as	public	safety	officers	to	receive	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award, regardless	of	their	calculated	SAI.	However,	all	other	Title	IV	aid	for	these	students	must	be	based	on	their	calculated	SAI. See	Volume	7,	Chapter	1	for	the	specific	eligibility	requirements	that	must	be	met	for	a	student	to	receive	the	maximum Pell	Grant	amount	under	the	Special	Rule,	and	guidance	on	identifying	eligible	students.

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	3:	Pell	Grant	Special	Rule	Packaging

A	full-time	independent	third-year	undergraduate	student	meets	the	eligibility	criteria	under	the	Special	Rule	(as described	in	Volume	7,	Chapter	1)	to	receive	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award.	The	student	has	a	COA	of	$15,000 and	an	SAI	of	9,000	for	the	award	year.	The	packaging	process	begins	with	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	of $7,500*.	Although	the	Pell	Grant	amount	exceeds	the	student9s	financial	need	of	$6,000	(as	determined	by subtracting	the	SAI	of	9,000	from	the	$15,000	COA),	no	overaward	is	created	because	the	student	qualifies	for	the maximum	Pell	Grant	award	under	the	Special	Rule.

The	student	has	no	eligibility	for	additional	need-based	aid,	but	the	school	awards	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	in the	amount	of	$7,500	to	fully	cover	the	student9s	COA:

## $15,000	COA

- -7,500	Pell	Grant
- -7,500	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan

## $0	remaining	costs

*The	$7,500	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	is	a	fictitious	amount	used	for	illustrative	purposes	only.	It	is	not	intended to	represent	the	actual	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	for	any	particular	award	year.

## Substituting	for	the	SAI

A	school	may	substitute	certain	types	of	aid	for	the	student9s	SAI.	Forms	of	aid	that	may	replace	the	student9s	SAI	include Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	TEACH	Grants,	Direct	PLUS	Loans,	state	loans,	private	education	loans,	or	any	other	non-needbased	loans.	Note	that	annual	loan	limits	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	still	apply,	and	the	total	aid	received	(including amounts	used	to	replace	the	SAI)	cannot	exceed	the	COA.

## Regulatory	Citations

## 34	CFR	685.200(e)

## 34	CFR	686.21(d)

Note: Although	the	cited	regulations	refer	to	the	expected	family	contribution,	these	provisions	continue	to	apply for	purposes	of	substituting	certain	types	of	aid	for	the	SAI.

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	4:	Replacing	the	SAI	With	Unsubsidized	Loan	Funds:	Dependent	Student

A	first-year	dependent	student	has	a	COA	of	$10,800	and	an	SAI	of	8,000,	so	the	student9s	financial	need	is $2,800:

$10,800	COA	-	8,000	SAI	=	$2,800	financial	need

The	student	is	not	eligible	for	a	Pell	Grant,	and	the	school	does	not	participate	in	the	Campus-Based	Programs. The	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a	first-year	dependent student	is	$5,500	(maximum	$3,500	subsidized).	The	student	qualifies	for	a	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	to	fully cover	their	financial	need.

Eligibility	for	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	is	determined	by	subtracting	OFA	from	the	COA	(the	SAI	is	not	taken	into consideration):

$10,800	COA	-	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	=	$8,000	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	eligibility

This	full	amount	cannot	be	covered	with	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	because	of	the	$5,500	combined	Direct Subsidized	Loan/Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit.	However,	the	student	is	eligible	to	borrow	an additional	$2,700	in	the	form	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	to	cover	part	of	the	SAI:

$5,500	combined	subsidized/unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	-	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	=	$2,700	in remaining	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	eligibility	under	the	annual	loan	limit

The	student9s	parents	could	then	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	As	with	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	eligibility	for Direct	PLUS	Loans	is	determined	by	subtracting	OFA	from	the	COA:

$10,800	COA	-	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	-	$2,700	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	=	$5,300	in	Direct	PLUS	Loan eligibility

The	Direct	PLUS	Loan	would	cover	the	remaining	portion	of	the	SAI	and	fully	cover	the	COA:

$10,800	COA	-	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	-	$2,700	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	-	$5,300	Direct	PLUS	Loan	=	$0 unmet	cost

As	an	alternative	to	the	student	taking	out	the	$2,700	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	the	student9s	parent	could borrow	up	to	$8,000	in	the	form	of	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	to	replace	the	SAI	and	fully	cover	the	COA:

$10,800	COA	-	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	=	$8,000	in	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility

Another	option	(to	eliminate	the	need	for	the	student	to	incur	any	student	loan	debt	at	all)	would	be	for	the student9s	parent	to	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	in	the	amount	of	$10,800	to	cover	the	full	COA.

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	5:	Replacing	the	SAI	With	Unsubsidized	Loan	Funds:	Independent	Student

A	first-year	independent	student	has	a	COA	of	$9,000	and	an	SAI	of	2,050,	resulting	in	financial	need	of	$6,950:

$9,000	COA	3	2,050	SAI	=	$6,950	financial	need

The	student	is	eligible	for	a	$5,450	Pell	Grant * ,	and	the	school	also	awards	a	$1,000	FSEOG.	This	leaves	the student	with	remaining	need	of	$600,	which	can	be	covered	with	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan:

$9,000	COA	3	2,050	SAI	-	$5,450	Pell	Grant	-	$1,000	FSEOG	=	$500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility

The	student9s	financial	need	is	now	fully	covered	by	the	Pell	Grant,	FSEOG,	and	Direct	Subsidized	Loan.

The	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a	first-year	independent student	is	$9,500	(maximum	$3,500	subsidized).

The	student	can	also	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	in	the	amount	of	$2,050	to	replace	the	SAI	and	fully cover	the	COA:

$9,000	COA	-	$5,450	Pell	-	$1,000	FSEOG	-	$500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	=	$2,050	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan eligibility

The	aid	package	now	fully	covers	the	student9s	COA:

$9,000	COA	-	$5,450	Pell	-	$1,000	FSEOG	-	$500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	-	$2,050	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	=	$0 unmet	cost

* The	$5,450	Pell	Grant	amount	shown	in	this	example	is	for	illustrative	purposes	only	and	is	not	intended	to represent	the	actual	Pell	Grant	amount	that	a	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive.	See	Volume	7	for	guidance	on the	determination	of	Pell	Grant	awards.

## Other	Financial	Assistance	(OFA)

In	contrast	to	Pell	Grants,	you	must	take	other	aid	into	account	when	awarding	TEACH	Grants,	Campus-Based	aid,	or Direct	Loans.	As	noted	earlier,	the	other	aid	that	must	be	considered	is	called	&lt;other	financial	assistance=	(OFA).	OFA	is generally	used	in	the	same	way	for	the	Direct	Loan	Program	as	for	the	TEACH	Grant	and	Campus-Based	programs. However,	there	are	differences	in	the	treatment	of	AmeriCorps	benefits,	as	discussed	later	in	this	chapter.

In	general,	OFA	as	defined	for	the	Direct	Loan,	Campus-Based,	and	TEACH	Grant	programs	refers	to	aid	from	the	Title	IV programs,	as	well	as	other	grants,	scholarships,	loans,	and	wages	from	need-based	employment	that	you	can	reasonably anticipate	at	the	time	you	award	aid	to	the	student,	whether	the	assistance	is	awarded	by	the	school	or	by	an	individual or	organization	outside	the	school.

If	aid	is	excluded	from	either	OFA	or	COA,	that	amount	must	be	excluded	from	both	OFA	and	COA.	For	Direct	Loans,	the regulations	specify	that	OFA	is	aid	that	the	student	will	receive	for	the	same	period	of	enrollment	as	the	loan.	As	noted	in Chapter	1,	it9s	usually	best	to	originate	a	loan	for	a	period	that	matches	the	academic	year	or	other	period	that	you9re using	to	award	funds	from	other	Title	IV	programs.	The	amount	of	a	private	education	loan	which	exceeds	the	SAI	when substituting	for	the	SAI	is	considered	OFA.

When	classifying	non-Title	IV	sources	of	aid,	if	a	student	receives	the	award	because	of	postsecondary	enrollment	(for example,	a	scholarship	from	a	local	social	club	that	requires	a	student	to	be	attending	a	postsecondary	school),	it	counts as	OFA	if	it	is	not	considered	wages	for	employment	according	to	federal	or	state	rules,	or	if	it	is	considered	wages	and	is based	on	need.	Any	amount	that	appears	as	income	on	the	tax	return	will	also	be	included	on	the	appropriate	line	on	the FAFSA	form	in	the	section	for	student	income.	If	the	award	is	considered	wages	for	employment	but	is	not	based	on	need, then	it	is	not	OFA	and	it	remains	in	income.

Compensation	that	a	student	athlete	receives	under	a	name,	image,	and	likeness	(NIL)	contract	is	a	non-need-based source	of	income	and	therefore	is	not	considered	OFA.

Table	1	at	the	end	of	this	section	provides	examples	of	what	is	and	is	not	considered	OFA.

## Estimated	Financial	Assistance

Campus-Based:	34	CFR	673.5(c)

Direct	Loans:	34	CFR	685.102(b)

HEA:	Sec.	428(a)(2)(C)(ii)

## Prepaid	Tuition	Plans

Prepaid	tuition	plans	are	not	considered	OFA.	Instead,	they	are	treated	the	same	as	Coverdell	education	and	529	savings accounts.	For	more	detail	see	the	discussion	of	qualified	education	benefits	or	education	savings	accounts	under	the heading	&lt;Student	Assets	(22)=	in	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide,	Chapter	2.

## OFA	Provided	by	a	State

If	the	assistance	provided	by	a	state	is	not	considered	Title	IV	assistance	and	is	designated	by	the	state	to	offset	a	specific component	of	the	student9s	COA,	the	amount	of	that	assistance	may	be	excluded	from	both	COA	and	OFA.	You	may exclude	such	assistance	on	a	student-by-student	basis,	but	if	it	is	excluded,	it	must	be	excluded	for	both	COA	and	OFA.	If the	amount	excluded	is	less	than	the	allowance	provided	in	the	student9s	COA,	you	must	exclude	the	lesser	amount.

## Exclusion	of	State-Provided	Assistance

HEA	Sec.	480(j)

## Counting	Need-Based	Earnings	as	OFA

For	students	who	have	jobs,	only	net	earnings	from need-based	employment are	considered	OFA.	&lt;Need-	based employment=	means	employment	that	is	awarded	by	the	school	itself	or	by	another	organization	to	a	student	based	on financial	need	to	meet	educational	expenses	for	the	award	year.

A	Federal	Work-Study	job	is	clearly	a	form	of	need-based	student	aid.	Employment	with	a	state	is	considered	OFA	if	that employment	is	based	on	the	student9s	financial	need	for	assistance	to	pay	for	educational	expenses.

Non-need-based	earnings are	not	to	be	considered	as	OFA	for	the	current	award	year	because	they	will	be	reported	as income	on	the	FAFSA	form	for	a	subsequent	award	year	and	will	be	used	in	calculating	the	future	SAI.	An	example	of	nonneed-based	employment	would	be	a	student's	job	with	a	private	employer	such	as	a	local	grocery	store.	Another	example would	be	a	job	cleaning	the	labs	in	the	chemistry	department	on	campus,	if	the	chemistry	department	hired	the	student using	non-need-based	criteria	and	funds.

## Exclusion	of	Emergency	Financial	Assistance	From	OFA

Under	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act,	emergency	financial	assistance	provided	to	a	student	is	excluded	from	OFA	when awarding	Title	IV	funds.	For	this	purpose,	emergency	financial	assistance	includes	any	grant	or	loan	aid	(whether institutional	funds	or	aid	from	some	other	non-Title	IV	source)	paid	to	a	student	for	unexpected	expenses,	if	those expenses	are	associated	with	one	of	the	allowable	COA	components	as	described	in	Chapter	2	of	this	volume.	This	could include,	for	example,	unexpected	expenses	for	food;	housing;	course	materials	or	equipment;	or	transportation	(for instance,	transportation	between	campus	and	home	for	a	death	or	family	emergency),	since	those	expense	categories	are allowable	COA	components.	The	school	is	responsible	for	determining	whether	an	unexpected	expense	is	associated	with a	COA	component.	In	addition,	the	expenses	must	not	already	be	included	in	one	of	the	student9s	COA	components.	Note also	that	the	determination	as	to	whether	emergency	financial	assistance	is	warranted	is	made	by	the	school	based	on	an individual	student9s	circumstances	and	need	not	be	tied	to	a	state	or	federal	declaration	of	a	disaster	or	emergency.

Before	providing	aid	to	a	student	who	has	requested	emergency	financial	assistance,	a	school	must	document	the request,	including	the	unexpected	expense	that	prompted	the	request,	and	should	retain	the	documentation	in	the student9s	file	for	the	normal	record	retention	period	(see	Volume	2,	Chapter	7	for	information	on	record	retention requirements).

As	a	result	of	a	change	made	by	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act,	only	federal	veterans	education	benefits	that	are specifically	listed	in	the	HEA	may	be	excluded	from	OFA.	Because	benefits	received	under	the	VRAP	and	VRRAP	programs are	not	included	in	the	statutory	list	of	federal	veterans	education	benefits	to	be	excluded	from	OFA,	they	have	been removed	from	this	list.

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Table	1:	Examples	of	Other	Financial	Assistance

## Counted	as	OFA

## Not	Counted	as	OFA

Any	educational	benefits	paid	because	of	enrollment in	postsecondary	education,	such	as:

- Pell	Grants;
- Direct	Subsidized	Loans	(gross	amount, including	origination	fees);
- Direct	Unsubsidized	and	PLUS	Loans	(gross amount,	including	origination	fees),	except amounts	used	to	replace	the	SAI	(see	below);
- Long-term	need-based	loans,	including	loans made	by	the	school	(but	not	short-term emergency	loans	3	see	&lt;Not	counted	as	OFA=);
- Wages	from	non-need-based	employment (including	compensation	received	by	student athletes	under	NIL	contracts);
- Veterans	education	benefits	listed	in	the Appendix	at	the	end	of	this	chapter;
- When	awarding	Campus-Based	or	TEACH	Grant funds,	the	amount	of	any	Direct	Subsidized Loan	that	is	equal	to	or	less	than	the	amount	of the	student9s	AmeriCorps	national	service education	awards	or	post-service	benefits	paid for	the	student9s	COA;
- When	determining	eligibility	for	Direct
- Grants,	including	FSEOG	and	state	grants;
- Scholarships,	including	athletic	scholarships and	scholarships	that	require	future employment	but	are	given	in	the	current	year;
- Employer	reimbursement	of	employee9s	tuition;
- Waivers	of	tuition	and	fees;
- Fellowships	or	assistantships,	except	non-needbased	employment	portions	of	such	awards;
- Income	from	insurance	programs	that	pay	for the	student9s	education;
- Net	income	from	need-based	employment	such as	FWS;
- AmeriCorps	awards	or	post-service	benefits (except	when	determining	eligibility	for	Direct Subsidized	Loans);
- McNair	Postbaccalaureate	Achievement Program;
- TEACH	Grants	(except	amounts	used	to	replace the	SAI	-	see	&lt;Not	counted	as	OFA=);
- Private	education	loans	(except	amounts	used to	replace	the	SAI	-	see	&lt;Not	counted	as	OFA=); and
- Funds	received	through	income	share agreements	(see	the	Note	below)	that	are	used to	finance	a	student9s	expenses	for postsecondary	education.

Note: A	student	loan	originator's	income	share	agreement	(ISA)	that	is	used	to	finance	a	student's postsecondary	education	expenses	is	considered	to	be	a	private	education	loan.	For	more	information	see the	March	2,	2022	Electronic	Announcement	posted	in	the	Knowledge	Center.

## Recalculation

Any	time	a	student	begins	attendance	in	at	least	one	course	but	does	not	begin	attendance	in	all	the	courses	they	were scheduled	to	attend	and	on	which	eligibility	for	Title	IV	Aid	was	based,	the	school	must	recalculate	the	student9s	eligibility for	Pell	Grants	and	TEACH	Grants,	based	on	the	revised	enrollment	intensity	(for	Pell	Grants)	or	enrollment	status	(for TEACH	Grants)	and	COA.	For	the	Campus-Based	programs,	if	a	change	in	a	student9s	enrollment	status	results	in	a	change in	the	student9s	COA,	the	school	must	recalculate	the	student9s	eligibility	based	on	the	revised	COA.	In	this	circumstance, the	$300	overaward	tolerance	under	the	Campus-Based	programs	does	not	apply	(see	&lt;Campus-Based	Overaward Threshold=	later	in	this	chapter	for	more	information).

A	school	may	adopt	a	recalculation	policy	that	is	stricter	than	what	the	regulations	require	(for	example,	a	policy	that requires	recalculation	up	to	a	census	date	or	any	time	within	a	term	or	period	of	enrollment).	If	a	school	adopts	a	policy	of

- Subsidized	Loans,	AmeriCorps	national	service education	awards	or	post-service	benefits;
- The	amounts	of	any	TEACH	Grants,	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans,	Direct	PLUS	Loans,	and non-federal	non-need-based	loans,	including private,	state-sponsored,	and	institutional loans,	that	are	used	to	replace	the	SAI (amounts	that	exceed	the	SAI	must	be	treated as	OFA);
- Foster	care	benefits	received	under	Title	IV, Part	E,	of	the	Social	Security	Act,	including education	and	training	vouchers	and	room	and board	that	students	receive	as	extended	foster care	benefits	under	Section	477	of	the	Social Security	Act;	and
- Emergency	financial	assistance	provided	to	a student	(for	example,	emergency	grants	or short-term	emergency	loans)	for	expenses	that are	associated	with	an	allowable	COA component	and	not	otherwise	included	in	the student9s	COA.

recalculating	Pell	Grants	and	TEACH	Grants	when	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity	or	status	changes	within	a	term	or period	of	enrollment,	the	policy	must	be	applied	consistently	to	all	students.	Therefore,	if	your	school	chooses	to recalculate	Pell	Grants	and	TEACH	Grants	for	a	student	whose	enrollment	intensity	or	enrollment	status	in	a	program increases	(for	example,	from	half-time	to	full-time),	it	must	also	recalculate	for	a	student	whose	enrollment	intensity	or status	decreases.

Once	you	have	recalculated	a	student9s	eligibility,	Title	IV	funds	in	excess	of	the	amount	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive must	be	returned	or	re-awarded,	as	applicable.	For	guidance	on	handling	excess	cash	resulting	from	recalculations	of	aid eligibility	due	to	enrollment	intensity	or	status	changes,	see	Volume	4,	Chapter	1.

## Recalculation	and	Direct	Loans

If	a	student9s	enrollment	status	changes	after	the	student	has	already	received	one	or	more	Direct	Loan	disbursements, no	recalculation	of	the	previously	disbursed	Direct	Loan	amount	is	required.	For	information	on	how	changes	in	enrollment status	may	affect	a	student9s	eligibility	to	receive	pending	Direct	Loan	disbursements,	see	Volume	8,	Chapter	1.

## Recalculation	and	Pell	Grants

Since	Pell	Grants	are	always	based	on	the	full-time	COA,	recalculation	means	that	you	are	looking	at	the	student9s	revised enrollment	intensity.	For	more	detail	on	recalculating	Pell	Grants,	see	Volume	7,	Chapter	7.

## Recalculating	COA

When	performing	a	recalculation	a	school	may	not	include	in	the	COA	costs	associated	with	any	classes	the	student	failed to	begin.	In	addition,	in	determining	a	student9s	COA	a	school	may	not	include	any	costs	for	a	period	when	the	student was	not	enrolled	in	and	attending	any	Title	IV	eligible	classes	(other	than	costs	for	a	brief	period	between	regularly scheduled	terms	or	semesters).	Note	that	some	components	of	COA	are	not	included	if	a	student	is	enrolled	less	than	half time	(see	Chapter	2	of	this	volume).

A	school	that	performs	a	Return	of	Title	IV	Funds	calculation	on	a	period	of	enrollment	basis	for	a	student	enrolled	in	a program	offered	in	modules	may	not	include	in	the	recalculated	COA	any	costs	associated	with	a	future	payment	period for	which	the	student	has	not	confirmed	attendance	at	the	time	of	withdrawal	and	that	does	not	start	within	45	days.

## COA	Changes	Between	or	Within	Payment	Periods

A	school	may	have	a	policy	of	recalculating	awards	only	when	the	COA	changes	from	one	payment	period	to	the	next,	and not	when	the	COA	changes	within	a	payment	period.	For	example,	a	school	could	recalculate	awards	because	of	changes to	a	student9s	tuition	and	fee	costs	or	living	situation	(e.g.,	when	a	student	moves	off	campus)	between	payment	periods.

However,	schools	also	have	the	option	to	establish	a	policy	of	recalculating	financial	aid	awards	when	a	student9s	costs change	within	a	payment	period.	For	instance,	if	a	student	with	no	dependents	moves	from	a	dormitory	to	off-campus housing	at	midterm,	a	school	could	choose	to	recalculate	the	student9s	award	for	that	payment	period.	For	Pell	Grant purposes,	such	a	policy	is	acceptable	if	it9s	carried	out	for	all	students	whose	costs	change	within	the	payment	period.

Note	that	schools	are	not	limited	to	one	or	the	other	of	the	policies	described	above.	Schools	may	have	a	policy	of recalculating	awards	when	there	is	a	change	in	costs	at	any	time	during	an	award	year	(whether	within	a	payment	period or	between	payment	periods),	as	long	as	the	recalculation	policy	is	carried	out	for	all	students	whose	costs	change.

Schools	may	not	recalculate	the	payment	for	a	payment	period	that	took	place before the	cost	change.	For	instance,	if	a student	lives	in	the	dormitory	during	the	first	quarter	and	then	moves	off	campus	for	the	second	and	third	quarters,	the recalculation	would	only	affect	the	payments	for	the	second	and	third	quarters.

## Crossover	Periods

Crossover	periods	are	payment,	award,	or	loan	periods	that	overlap	two	award	years.	With	one	exception,	you	may choose	which	award	year	SAI	to	use	for	a	student.	The	exception	is	that	when	awarding	FWS	to	a	student	not	attending classes,	the	SAI	for	the	next	period	of	enrollment	must	be	used.

Table	2	at	the	end	of	this	section	summarizes	the	options	for	handling	crossover	payment	periods	in	the	Title	IV	programs. Note	that	for	the	award	year	selected,	the	student	must	have	an	official	SAI	calculated	by	the	FAFSA	Processing	System (FPS),	and	for	a	Pell	Grant	the	FPS	must	also	have	processed	a	valid	Institutional	Student	Information	Record	(ISIR)	or

FAFSA	Submission	Summary.

## Pell	Crossover	Issues

For	Pell	Grant	purposes,	you	may	assign	crossover	payment	periods	to	the	award	year	that	best	meets	the	needs	of	your students	and	maximizes	a	student9s	eligibility	over	the	two	award	years	in	which	the	crossover	payment	period	occurs. You	may	assign	the	Pell	Grant	award	to	a	different	award	year	than	the	award	year	used	for	awarding	the	rest	of	the student9s	Title	IV	aid.	For	more	detail	on	calculating	Pell	Grant	awards	in	crossover,	summer,	mini-session,	and	transfer situations,	see/Volume	7,	Chapter	5.

## Crossover	Period	SAIs	and	Title	IV	Aid

In	a	crossover	payment	period,	when	using	Pell	Grant	funds	from	a	different	award	year	than	the	award	year	used	to award	other	Title	IV	aid,	you	must	use	the	same	SAI,	COA,	and	need	for	all	programs	except	the	Pell	Grant	Program.	For Pell	Grants,	you	use	the	SAI,	COA,	and	need	for	the	award	year	from	which	the	student	will	be	paid,	and	use	the	amount	of Pell	Grant	funds	received	in	determining	remaining	need	when	packaging	aid	from	other	Title	IV	programs.

Veterans	Education	Benefits

For	Title	IV	purposes,	federal	veterans	education	benefits,	as	defined	under	Section	480(c)	of	the	HEA,	are	not	treated	as

OFA.	You	can	ask	the	student	to	identify	the	specific	program	under	which	they	are	receiving	their	veterans	education benefits.	Veterans	education	benefits	are	also	not	to	be	counted	as	income,	and	therefore	are	not	reported	as	income	on the	FAFSA	form.	For	a	list	of	federal	veterans	education	benefits	that	are	to	be	excluded	from	OFA,	see	the	Appendix	at the	end	of	this	chapter.

Noneducational	veterans	benefits are	also	not	counted	as	OFA.	Noneducational	veterans	benefits	include	Death Pension	and	Dependency	and	Indemnity	Compensation	(DIC)	benefits,	and	income	from	the	Veteran9s	Affairs	Student Work-Study	Allowance	Program	(VASWSAP).	The	student	must	report	these	noneducational	benefits	as	nontaxable	income on	the	FAFSA	form.

Veterans	Benefits	Not	OFA

## August	13,	2009	Electronic	Announcement

HEA	480(c)

## AmeriCorps	Benefits

AmeriCorps	benefits	are	not	included	as	OFA	when	determining	eligibility	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans,	but	they	are counted	as	OFA	when	determining	eligibility	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.

When	packaging	Campus-Based	or	TEACH	Grant	awards,	you	may	exclude	from	the	OFA	any	portion	of	a	Direct Subsidized	Loan	that	is	equal	to	or	less	than	the	amount	of	the	student9s	AmeriCorps	benefits.

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	6:	Packaging	When	a	Student	Receives	AmeriCorps	Benefits

A	third-year	dependent	student	has	a	COA	of	$15,000	and	an	SAI	of	2,400,	and	is	receiving	a	$5,100	Pell	Grant*, $3,000	in	AmeriCorps	benefits	and	$1,000	in	FSEOG.	Because	AmeriCorps	benefits	are	not	counted	as	OFA	when determining	eligibility	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	you	may	award	the	student	$5,500	in	Direct	Subsidized	Loan funds:

$15,000	COA	3	2,400	SAI	3	$5,100	Pell	Grant*	3	$1,000	FSEOG	=	$6,500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility	(limited to	$5,500	because	of	the	annual	loan	limit)

In	contrast,	AmeriCorps	benefits	are	considered	OFA	when	determining	eligibility	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans. Therefore,	the	student	may	receive	an	additional	$455	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	to	replace	part	of	the SAI	and	fully	cover	the	COA:

$15,000	COA	3	$5,100	Pell	Grant*	3	$1,000	FSEOG	3	$3,000	AmeriCorps	benefits	3	$5,500	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan	=	$400	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	eligibility

*The	$5,100	Pell	Grant	amount	shown	in	this	example	is	for	illustrative	purposes	only	and	is	not	intended	to represent	the	actual	Pell	Grant	amount	that	a	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive.	See	Volume	7	for	guidance	on the	determination	of	Pell	Grant	awards.

## Vocational	Rehabilitation	Funds

If	you	have	a	student	who	qualifies	for	both	Title	IV	funds	and	for	vocational	rehabilitation	assistance	funds,	you	should determine	the	student9s	aid	package	without	including	costs	related	to	the	student9s	disability	in	the	student9s	COA,	and without	including	anticipated	vocational	rehabilitation	assistance	as	OFA.	In	this	way,	a	student	with	disabilities	will	be offered	the	same	aid	package	as	a	student	who	is	in	the	same	financial	situation	but	who	doesn9t	have	disabilities;	the student	with	disabilities	will	also	receive	the	maximum	amount	of	vocational	rehabilitation	aid	to	which	they	are	entitled. If	the	vocational	rehabilitation	agency	doesn9t	fully	meet	the	student9s	disability	costs,	you	may	wish	to	include	the	unmet disability	expenses	in	the	student9s	COA	and	increase	the	aid	award.

## Vocational	Rehabilitation	Agreements	with	State	Agencies

Some	state	vocational	rehabilitation	agencies	have	established	agreements	with	schools	that	specify	how	vocational rehabilitation	assistance	will	be	coordinated	with	other	forms	of	financial	aid.	Check	with	your	school9s	vocational rehabilitation	coordinator	to	see	if	it	has	such	an	agreement.

Although	vocational	rehabilitation	funds	shouldn9t	be	considered	OFA	when	you	initially	package	aid	for	a	student,	you must	coordinate	funds	available	from	the	vocational	rehabilitation	agency	and	from	institutional,	state,	and	federal student	financial	assistance	programs	to	prevent	an	overaward.	The	amount	of	assistance	from	the	vocational rehabilitation	agency	must	be	documented	in	the	student9s	file.

## Coordination	With	Bureau	of	Indian	Affairs	Grants

When	packaging	Campus-Based	aid	for	a	student	who	is	or	may	be	eligible	for	a	Bureau	of	Indian	Affairs	(BIA)	grant,	you must	first	develop	a	financial	aid	package	without	considering	any	BIA	funds.	If	the	total	aid	package4after	BIA	funds	are added4does	not	exceed	the	student9s	need,	no	adjustment	may	be	made	to	the	aid	package.	If	the	total	package	plus	the BIA	grant	does	exceed	need,	you	must	eliminate	the	excess	in	the	following	sequence:	loans,	work-study	awards,	and grants	other	than	Pell	Grants	(you	may	not	reduce	a	Pell	Grant	or	BIA	grant).	You	may	alter	this	sequence	of	reductions upon	the	student9s	request	if	you	believe	it	would	benefit	the	student.	We	encourage	you	to	consult	with	area	officials	in charge	of	BIA	postsecondary	financial	aid	when	packaging	Title	IV	funds	with	BIA	grants.

Coordination	of	BIA	Grants	With	Campus-Based	Aid

## 34	CFR	673.6

Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	Example	7:	Vocational	Rehabilitation	Packaging

A	third-year	dependent	undergraduate	with	no	financial	need	will	receive	$4,000	in	vocational	rehabilitation	aid for	the	academic	year.	The	original	COA	at	the	student9s	school	is	$5,000.	In	determining	the	original	COA,	the school	coordinates	funding	with	the	vocational	rehabilitation	agency	and	chooses	to	exclude	all	disability-related expenses	that	will	be	covered	by	the	vocational	rehabilitation	aid.	However,	the	student	has	$2,000	in	additional disability-related	expenses	that	the	vocational	rehabilitation	aid	will	not	cover,	so	the	school	increases	the	COA	to $7,000	and	awards	the	student	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	that	amount.

Although	the	combined	amount	of	the	$7,000	Direct	Loan	and	the	$4,000	in	vocational	rehabilitation	aid	exceeds the	COA,	there	is	no	overaward.	This	is	because	the	$7,000	COA	does	not	include	$4,000	in	disability-related expenses	that	are	covered	by	the	student9s	vocational	rehabilitation	aid.	Since	the	$4,000	in	vocational rehabilitation	aid	is	not	covering	any	component	of	the	COA,	it	must	also	not	be	counted	as	OFA.	However,	if	the school	had	not	initially	excluded	from	the	COA	all	the	disability-related	expenses	that	were	covered	by	the	$4,000 in	vocational	rehabilitation	aid,	the	amount	of	the	vocational	rehabilitation	aid	that	exceeded	the	excluded disability	expenses	would	have	to	be	counted	as	OFA.

## Treatment	of	Overawards

If, at	any	time	during	the	award	period ,	a	student	receives	additional	OFA	that	was	not	considered	in	calculating	the student9s	eligibility	for	Campus-Based	aid,	and	if	the	OFA	combined	with	the	expected	financial	aid	will	exceed	the student9s	need,	the	amount	in	excess	of	the	student9s	need	is	considered	an	overaward.

The	treatment	of	overawards	in	the	Direct	Loan	Program	depends	on	whether	the	loan	has	been	fully	disbursed.	If	you discover	that	there	will	be	an	overaward	before	Direct	Loan	funds	are	disbursed,	you	must	eliminate	the	overaward through	the	packaging	process	by	canceling	or	reducing	the	amount	of	the	Direct	Loan,	or	by	canceling	or	reducing	other aid	over	which	you	have	direct	institutional	control.

If	the	overaward	occurs	after	Direct	Loan	funds	have	been	disbursed	to	the	borrower,	there	is	no	Direct	Loan	overaward that	needs	to	be	addressed;	however,	you	might	need	to	adjust	the	student9s	aid	package	to	prevent	an	overaward	of Campus-Based	funds.

See	Volume	4,	Chapter	3,	for	a	full	discussion	of	overawards	for	all	programs.

## Campus-Based	Overaward	Threshold

Campus-Based	aid	need	not	be	reduced	if	the	overaward	doesn9t	exceed	$300,	which	is	the	overaward	threshold	for	all Campus-Based	programs.	Note	that	the	$300	threshold	is	allowed	only	if	an	overaward	occurs	after	Campus-Based	aid has	been	packaged	and	the	school	was	unaware	the	student	would	receive	additional	funds.	The	threshold	does	not	allow a	school	to	deliberately	award	Campus-Based	aid	that,	in	combination	with	other	resources,	exceeds	the	student9s financial	need.

## Prohibition	on	Using	Pell	To	Pay	Loans

If	a	Pell	Grant	recipient9s	aid	package	includes	a	loan	and	the	package	must	be	adjusted	to	prevent	an	overaward,	the	Pell Grant	funds	can9t	be	used	to	pay	back	the	loan.	A	payment	on	a	student	loan	isn9t	an	educational	expense.

Other	Packaging	Considerations

## Initially	Ineligible	Programs	That	Gain	Eligibility

If	a	previously	ineligible	program	later	gains	Title	IV	eligibility,	you	may	award	non-loan	Title	IV	aid	to	students	who	are already	enrolled	in	the	program	retroactive	to	the	beginning	of	the	payment	period	in	which	the	program	becomes eligible,	and	you	may	award	Direct	Loans	retroactive	to	the	beginning	of	the	period	of	enrollment	(usually	the	academic year)	in	which	the	program	becomes	eligible,	assuming	that	all	other	student,	program,	and	school	eligibility	requirements are	met.	You	may	not	award	Title	IV	aid	for	payment	periods	(non-loan	programs)	or	periods	of	enrollment	(Direct	Loans) that	a	student	has	already	completed	at	the	time	the	program	gains	eligibility.

## Financial	Aid	Offers	and	Notification	Requirements

Many	schools	use	a	financial	aid	offer,	in	either	paper	or	electronic	format,	to	notify	students	of	their	proposed	aid package.	Whether	you	use	a	paper	letter	or	other	electronic	means	such	as	email,	you	must	fulfill	the	consumer information	requirements,	as	described	in	Volume	2,	Chapter	6.	You	are	also	responsible	for	certain	notifications	and authorizations	at	the	time	of	disbursement,	as	described	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	1.

Schools	may	choose	to	use	the	College	Financing	Plan,	developed	by	the	Department	as	a	standardized	form	to	simplify cost	and	financial	aid	information	provided	to	prospective	students.
