## Volume	7

## The	Federal	Pell	Grant	Program

## Introduction

This	volume	of	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Handbook	provides	information	to	assist	schools	in	determining	student	eligibility for	and	calculating	the	amount	of	Federal	Pell	Grants.

Significant	Changes	for	2025326

Throughout	Volume	7,	all	dates,	award	years,	and	dollar	values	have	been	updated	to	reflect	the	2025326	processing year.	Also,	where	appropriate,	links	and	publications	associated	with	FSA9s	Partner	Connect	and	Knowledge	Center	have been	updated.

Note: Statutory	citations	are	to	the	Higher	Education	Act	(HEA)	of	1965,	as	amended.

## Chapter	1

We	added	a	reminder	that	schools	must	work	with	any	student	who	indicates	on	the	FAFSA	form	that	their	parent	or guardian	was	killed	in	the	line	of	duty	to	document	and,	if	determined	eligible,	certify	eligibility	for	a	maximum	Pell	Grant under	the	Special	Rule.

## Chapter	2

In	the	&lt;Calculated	Pell=	section,	we	added	set	of	steps	for	determining	the	calculated	Scheduled	Award	to	clarify	when	a school	should	and	should	not	round	to	the	nearest	$5.	We	updated	the	examples	to	demonstrate	these	steps.

## Chapter	3

We	added	a	section	titled	&lt;Less	Than	Half	Time	Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance=	to	demonstrate	this	concept	and	provide an	example	of	how	a	Pell	Grant	may	be	limited	by	a	less-than-half-time	COA.

## Chapter	4

We	added	a	fourth	example	titled	&lt;Less-than-half-time	Enrollment	and	Pell	Grant	COA=	to	the	&lt;Pell	Formula	1=	section, which	incorporates	the	concept	of	a	less-than-half-time	Pell	Grant	COA	with	a	less-than-half-time	enrollment	intensity proration.

There	were	no	substantive	changes	in	Chapters	5-8	or	the	Appendix.

## Chapter	1

## Student	Eligibility	for	Pell	Grants

## General	Eligibility	Requirements	for	Federal	Pell	Grants

In	general,	a	student	must	be	enrolled	in	an	undergraduate	course	of	study	at	a	non-foreign	institution	to	receive	a	Pell Grant.	For	the	Pell	Grant	program,	a	student	is	an	undergraduate	only	if	the	student	has	not	earned	or	completed	the requirements	for	a	bachelor9s	or	professional	degree.	A	student	who	has	earned	a	baccalaureate	degree	or	a	first professional	degree	cannot	receive	a	Pell	Grant.	However,	students	enrolled	in	an	eligible	post	baccalaureate	program	as described	below	are	still	considered	undergraduates	for	purposes	of	Pell	Grant	eligibility.

## Definition	of	an	Undergraduate	Student

## 34	CFR	668.2

A	student	who	completes	a	master9s	program	has	earned	a	degree	beyond	the	baccalaureate	level,	making	the	student ineligible	for	a	Pell	Grant	even	if	they	do	not	have	a	bachelor9s	degree	and	enroll	in	an	undergraduate	program.	Most professional	degrees	are	also	considered	beyond	the	baccalaureate	level;	the	same	restrictions	apply	to	students	who have	earned	professional	degrees	considered	beyond	the	baccalaureate	level.

A	student	who	has	received	an	associate	degree4or	any	certificate	or	diploma	below	the	baccalaureate	level4and	who enrolls	in	another	undergraduate	program	continues	to	be	considered	an	undergraduate	student	until	the	student	has completed	the	curriculum	requirements	for	a	first	bachelor9s	degree.

A	student	with	a	baccalaureate	or	professional	degree	is	ineligible	even	if	the	degree	is	from	an	unaccredited	school	or	is not	accepted	for	admission	or	transfer	credit	by	your	school.	Similarly,	a	student	with	a	baccalaureate	or	professional degree	from	a	foreign	school	usually	isn9t	eligible	for	a	Pell	Grant.	But	because	a	foreign	degree	often	won9t	translate neatly	into	the	American	classification,	the	school	must	judge	whether	it	equates	to	a	U.S.	bachelor9s	degree.	If	the student	provides	written	documentation	that	the	foreign	degree	is	not	equivalent	to	a	bachelor9s	degree	awarded	in	the United	States,	you	may	determine	that	the	student	does	not	have	a	bachelor9s	degree.	Documents	supporting	such	a conclusion	may	include	information	about	the	type	of	school	the	student	attended	and	total	years	of	education	leading	to the	degree.

A	student	enrolled	in	a	program	that	lasts	longer	than	five	years,	typically	first	professional	degree	programs	such	as	a six-year	pharmacy	program,	can	be	considered	an	undergraduate	for	only	the	first	three	or	four	years.	Students	enrolled in	dual-degree	programs	that	confer	a	bachelor9s	degree	and	either	a	graduate	or	first	professional	degree	are undergraduates	for	at	least	the	first	three	years	of	the	program.	The	school	determines	at	what	point	after	three	years	the student	ceases	to	be	an	undergraduate	student.	The	student	must	be	considered	a	graduate	student	after	the	fourth	year of	such	programs	(see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	for	further	discussion).

Occasionally,	a	student	will	complete	all	the	requirements	for	a	bachelor9s	degree	but	will	continue	taking	undergraduate courses	without	accepting	the	degree.	Your	school	must	decide	whether	and	at	what	point	the	student	completed	the baccalaureate	course	of	study.	If	your	school	determines	that	the	student	did	complete	a	bachelor9s	program	(regardless of	whether	the	student	accepted	the	degree),	then	the	student	is	no	longer	eligible	to	receive	a	Pell	Grant.

## Wrong	Grade	Level	on	the	FAFSA	Form

When	an	undergraduate	student	incorrectly	reports	on	the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA ® )	form	that the	student	will	be	a	graduate	student	or	has	a	bachelor9s	degree,	the	student	must	correct	that	information.	Because	the application	shows	that	the	student	isn9t	an	undergraduate,	the	Department9s	records	will	show	that	the	student	is ineligible	for	Pell.	If	the	application	isn9t	corrected,	the	school	won9t	be	able	to	pay	the	student	a	Pell	Grant.

Eligible	Postbaccalaureate	Program

A	student	who	is	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	a	postbaccalaureate	teacher	certification	or	licensure	program	is	eligible	to receive	a	Pell	Grant	for	the	period	necessary	to	complete	the	program	if:

- The	program	does	not	lead	to	a	graduate	degree;
- The	school	offering	the	program	does	not	also	offer	a	bachelor9s	degree	in	education;
- The	student	is	pursuing	an	initial	teacher	certification	or	licensing	credential	within	a	state;	and
- The	program	consists	of	the	courses	required	by	a	state	to	receive	a	professional	certification	or	licensing	credential necessary	for	employment	as	a	teacher	in	an	elementary	or	secondary	school	in	that	state.

Under	this very	limited	provision ,	a	postbaccalaureate	program	is	defined	as	a	program	that	generally	requires	a student	to	have	a	bachelor9s	degree	before	being	admitted	to	the	program.	Accordingly,	a	program	in	which undergraduate	students	are	routinely	allowed	to	enroll	would	not	meet	the	definition	of	a	postbaccalaureate	program	for this	purpose,	nor	would	a	program	that	is	generally	open	to	undergraduates	but	that	also	admits	students	with	bachelor9s degrees.	For	Title	IV	purposes,	a	school	must	treat	a	student	who	receives	a	Pell	Grant	under	this	provision	as	enrolled	in an	undergraduate	program.	Such	a	student	is	eligible	for	Federal	Work-Study	and	fifth-year	undergraduate	(not	graduate student)	Direct	Loan	limits	but	would	not	be	eligible	for	a	Federal	Supplemental	Educational	Opportunity	Grant	(FSEOG).

## Eligible	Postbaccalaureate	Programs

## 34	CFR	690.6(c)

HEA	Sec.	401(d)(4)(B)

## Eligible	Postbaccalaureate	Program	and	the	FAFSA

Normally,	students	who	indicate	on	the	FAFSA	that	they	have	a	bachelor9s	degree	won9t	be	listed	in	the	Department9s records	as	Pell-eligible	students,	and	the	school	won9t	be	able	to	receive	Pell	funds	for	them.	However,	to	allow	students who	are	eligible	under	the	postbaccalaureate	program	provision	to	be	paid,	students	who	correctly	report	that	they	have	a bachelor9s	degree	but	also	indicate	on	the	FAFSA	form	that	they	are	in	a	teaching	credential	program	will	be	listed	as	Pelleligible	students.	Of	course,	you	must	determine	whether	the	student	falls	under	the	eligible	postbaccalaureate	provision.

Prohibition	on	Receiving	Two	Pell	Grant	Payments	for	Concurrent	Enrollment

A	student	may	not	receive	Pell	Grant	payments	concurrently	from	more	than	one	school.	If	a	student	is	awarded	Pell	for any	period	of	concurrent	enrollment,	the	student	has	the	choice	of	which	award	to	receive	but	is	limited	to	a	single	award from	a	single	school.

For	Pell	purposes,	the	phrase	&lt;concurrently	from	more	than	one	institution=	means	that	the	student	must	be	attending both	schools	at	the	same	time	for	the	concurrent	Pell	Grant	prohibition	to	apply.	A	student	who	withdraws	from	one	school and	enrolls	at	least	one	day	later	in	another	school	is	normally	not	considered	to	have	been	enrolled	concurrently.	If	a Pell-eligible	student	withdraws	from	one	institution	but	meets	one	of	the	Return	of	Title	IV	Funds	(R2T4)	withdrawal exemptions	and	subsequently	enrolls	at	a	different	institution	during	the	same	payment	period,	the	new	institution	can award	Pell	Grant	funds	for	any	remaining	portion	of	the	overlapping	payment	period.	See	Chapter	6	of	this	volume	for additional	information	on	awarding	remaining	eligibility	for	a	transfer	student.	The	new	institution	should	maintain documentation	in	the	student9s	file	supporting	a	Pell	Grant	disbursement	at	that	institution	following	the	student's withdrawal	from	the	prior	school.

## 34	CFR	690.11

HEA	Section	401(d)(3)

## Pell	Eligibility	for	Incarcerated	Students

Section	484(t)	of	the	HEA	established	Pell	Grant	eligibility	for	confined	or	incarcerated	students	if	they	are	enrolled	in	an eligible	Prison	Education	Program	(PEP).	A	confined	or	incarcerated	individual	is	eligible	to	receive	a	Pell	Grant	if	that individual	enrolls	in	an	eligible	PEP.	For	additional	information	about	PEPs,	see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	and	Volume	2, Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

Institutions	that	participated	in	the	Second	Chance	Pell	(SCP)	experiment	under	the	Experimental	Sites	Initiative	(ESI) were	invited	to	apply	to	participate	in	a	revised	version	of	the	experiment.	The	revised	SCP	program	allows	institutions participating	in	the	experiment	as	of	July	1,	2023,	to	continue	offering	their	current	programs	to	confined	or	incarcerated individuals	for	up	to	three	award	years	while	they	work	through	the	application	and	approval	process	for	the	PEP(s)	they wish	to	offer	under	the	new	provisions.	See	Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-23-25	for	additional	information.	The revised	SCP	experiment	will	end	on	June	30,	2026;	schools	will	not	be	permitted	to	disburse	Pell	Grant	funds	under	the experiment	beyond	the	2025-26	award	year.

## Cost	of	Attendance	for	Incarcerated	Students

The	cost	of	attendance	for	students	who	are	incarcerated	may	include	the	following:	tuition,	fees,	books,	course	materials, supplies,	equipment,	and	the	cost	of	obtaining	a	license,	certification,	or	a	first	professional	credential.	For	more information	on	the	cost	of	attendance,	see	Volume	3,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

Confined	or	incarcerated	individuals	may	not	receive	Pell	Grant	funds	for	more	than	their	cost	of	attendance	and	may	not receive	a	Title	IV	credit	balance.	To	ensure	that	all	allowable	costs	are	included	in	the	cost	of	the	attendance,	schools must	include	books,	course	materials,	equipment,	and	supplies	as	part	of	institutional	charges	and	either	provide	those materials	directly	to	the	individual	or	include	the	costs	of	books	and	supplies	in	the	individual9s	tuition	and	fees.	If	a	credit balance	is	created,	the	school	must	return	the	Pell	Grant	funds	associated	with	the	credit	balance	to	the	Department	and it	will	be	credited	to	the	student's	remaining	Pell	eligibility.

Maximum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	for	Dependents	of	Certain	Deceased	Servicemembers	and	Public	Safety	Officers

Students	who	meet	the	eligibility	requirements	for	Pell	Grants	under	the	Special	Rule	in	HEA	Section	401(c)	will	receive	a maximum	Pell	Grant	award,	regardless	of	their	calculated	SAI.	To	receive	a	Pell	Grant	based	on	eligibility	under	the Special	Rule,	a	student	must	be:

- The	child	of	a	parent	or	guardian	who	died	in	the	line	of	duty	while	either	(a)	serving	on	active	duty	as	a	member	of the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	on	or	after	September	11,	2001;	or	(b)	actively	serving	as	and	performing	the	duties	of	a public	safety	officer;	and
- Less	than	33	years	old	as	of	the	January	1	prior	to	the	award	year	for	which	the	applicant	is	applying	(e.g.,	for	the 2025326	award	year,	a	student	must	be	less	than	33	years	old	as	of	January	1,	2025,	to	be	eligible).

In	this	situation,	eligible	students	will	have	a	Scheduled	Award	equal	to	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	award,	regardless	of	SAI. Other	aid	for	these	students	will	be	based	on	their	calculated	SAI.

Pell	Grants	Under	the	Special	Rule

HEA	Section	401(c)

Public	Safety	Officer	Definition

A	public	safety	officer	generally	includes	the	following:

- Law	enforcement	officer
- Firefighter
- Member	of	a	rescue	squad	or	ambulance	crew
- Federal	Emergency	Management	Agency	(FEMA)	employee
- Emergency	management	or	civil	defense	agency	employee
- Chaplain
- Others	defined	in	Section	1204	of	the	Omnibus	Crime	Control	and	Safe	Streets	Act	of	1968	(34	U.S.C.	10284)

Identification	of	Eligibility	and	Acceptable	Documentation

The	U.S.	Department	of	Defense	does	not	provide	confirmation	that	a	service	member	killed	in	the	line	of	duty	meets	the special	eligibility	criteria.	Further,	no	comprehensive	federal	database	exists	to	effectively	and	efficiently	identify	public safety	officers	killed	in	the	line	of	duty.	Therefore,	students	will	self-identify	potential	eligibility	on	the	FAFSA	form,	and	the school	will	be	required	to	confirm	eligibility	by	collecting	supporting	documentation	from	the	student.	Once	you	document and	certify	Special	Rule	eligibility	for	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	award,	neither	your	school	nor	any	other	school	is	required	to redetermine	that	student's	eligibility	for	subsequent	award	years	if	the	student	continues	to	meet	all	other	Pell	Grant eligibility	requirements	and	the	age	requirement	for	the	Special	Rule.

Acceptable	documentation may include,	but	is	not	limited	to,	the	following:

- A	copy	of	the	servicemember9s	DD	Form	1300	(Report	of	Casualty)	which	documents	death	in	the	line	of	duty.
- A	copy	of	the	servicemember9s	DD	Form	214	and	death	certificate,	documenting	that	the	date	and	cause	of	death occurred	during	and	as	a	result	of	active	duty.
- A	copy	of	a	Department	of	Veterans	Affairs	Death	Narrative	Document.
- A	determination	letter	acknowledging	eligibility	for	certain	federal	benefits	under	the	Public	Safety	Officers	Benefit (PSOB)	program	administered	by	the	Department	of	Justice.
- A	written	letter	of	attestation	or	determination	made	by	a	state	or	local	government	official	with	supervisory	or	other relevant	oversight	authority	of	an	individual	who	died	in	the	line	of	duty	while	serving	as	a	public	safety	officer.
- Documentation	of	the	student	qualifying	for	a	state	tuition	or	other	state	benefit	accorded	to	the	surviving	children	or other	family	members	of	a	public	safety	officer.
- Other	documentation	the	school	determines	to	be	from	a	credible	source	that	describes	or	reports	the	circumstances of	the	death	and	the	eligible	occupation	of	the	parent	or	guardian.

Note: You	must	work	with	any	student	who	indicates	on	the	FAFSA	form	that	their	parent	or	guardian	was	killed	in the	line	of	duty	to	document	and,	if	determined	eligible,	certify	eligibility	for	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	under	the Special	Rule.	This	includes	students	who	may	otherwise	qualify	for	a	Max	Pell	Grant	based	on	SAI	or	other eligibility	criteria.	Since	eligibility	under	the	Special	Rule	does	not	need	to	be	redetermined	annually,	certifying	a student	as	eligible	under	the	Special	Rule	allows	the	student	to	continue	receiving	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	in subsequent	award	years,	regardless	of	financial	information.

## Legacy	IASG	and	CFH	Eligibility

Students	who	were	eligible	for	and	received	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	Service	Grant	(IASG)	funds	or	received	Pell	Grant	funds based	on	IASG	or	Children	of	Fallen	Heroes	(CFH)	eligibility	criteria	for	the	2023-24	award	year	but	are	not	eligible	for	Pell Grant	funds	under	the	Special	Rule	beginning	with	the	2024325	award	year	are	eligible	to	receive	Pell	Grant	funds	based on	prior	IASG	or	CFH	eligibility	criteria.	Students	remain	eligible	if	they	received	at	least	one	disbursement	of	Pell	Grant	or IASG	funds	based	on	their	IASG	or	CFH	eligibility	during	the	2023-24	award	year	and	continue	to	meet	the	age requirement	for	the	Special	Rule.	Students	who	receive	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	based	on	legacy	IASG	or	CFH	guidance continue	to	be	eligible	if	the	student	received	at	least	one	disbursement	of	funds	based	on	the	grandfathered	eligibility	in each	subsequent	award	year.	If	there	is	a	break	in	disbursement	of	one	award	year,	then	the	student	must	qualify	under the	Special	Rule	in	HEA	Section	401(c).

## Certification	and	Reporting

Schools	report	maximum	Pell	Grant	eligibility	based	on	either	(1)	Special	Rule	criteria	eligibility	or	(2)	legacy	eligibility	due to	prior	IASG	or	CFH	criteria	to	the	Department	via	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(FPP).	Once	reported,	the	FAFSA	Processing System	(FPS)	will	generate	a	new	ISIR	transaction	reflecting	the	student9s	eligibility.	This	updated	ISIR	transaction	will allow	you	to	originate	and	disburse	a	maximum	Pell	Grant	for	eligible	students.	Applicants	who	meet	Special	Rule eligibility	will	be	reported	as	simply	eligible.	There	will	be	a	separate	value	for	students	who	meet	the	requirements	for legacy	eligibility.	See	Volume	4	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA	Specifications	Guide	for	additional	information.

## Chapter	2

## Calculating	Pell	Grants

Pell	Grant	Scheduled	Awards	are	based	on	information	provided	on	the	FAFSA	form,	the	presence	of	a	valid	Student	Aid Index	(SAI)	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR,	the	academic	year	structure	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1), and	the	Pell	Grant	cost	of	attendance	(COA)	for	a	full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	2).	For term-based	programs,	awards	for	part-time	students	are	adjusted	based	on	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity.

Scheduled	Award,	Award	Year,	and	Annual	Award

The Scheduled	Award is	the	maximum	amount	a	student	can	receive	during	the	award	year	if	the	student	attends	full time	for	a	full	academic	year.	The	award	year	begins	on	July	1	of	one	year	and	ends	on	June	30	of	the	next	year.	For example,	the	2025-26	award	year	begins	July	1,	2025,	and	ends	June	30,	2026.	The	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is established	by	the	school	using	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA	and	the	information	received	on	the	student9s	ISIR,	which	will include	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	eligibility	and	SAI.

The annual	award is	the	maximum	amount	a	student	would	receive	during	a	full	academic	year	based	on	enrollment intensity	and	COA.	Note	that	for	a	full-time	student,	the	annual	award	will	be	the	same	as	the	Scheduled	Award.	A	parttime	student	who	is	enrolled	in	a	term-based	program	will	have	an	annual	award	that	is	less	than	the	Scheduled	Award.

Published	Maximum	and	Minimum	Pell	Grant	Award	Amounts

The	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	amount	is	determined	by	the	appropriation	Act	applicable	to	that	award	year.	The Department	will	announce	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	amount	for	the	award	year,	as	required,	when	the	amount	is available.	The	minimum	Pell	Grant	award	amount	will	be	10%	of	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award	amount	for	the	award year.	Both	the	maximum	and	minimum	award	amounts	will	be	rounded	to	the	nearest	$5.	You	should	refer	to	the Knowledge	Center	for	the	most	updated	information.

Note: /Examples	use	fictional	maximum	($7,500)	and	minimum	($750)	Pell	Grant	award	amounts	for demonstration	purposes	only.	Award	amounts	in	examples	in	this	volume	should	not	be	used	in	packaging	Pell Grants	for	the	2025-26	award	year.

Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Criteria

A	student	may	qualify	for	a	Pell	Grant	under	one	of	three	sets	of	eligibility	criteria:

- Maximum	Pell	Grant	eligibility	(Max	Pell)
- Minimum	Pell	Grant	eligibility	(Min	Pell)
- Calculated	Pell	Grant	eligibility,	based	on	SAI

If	FPS	has	determined	that	a	student's	ISIR	transaction	is	eligible	for	a	Pell	Grant,	the	&lt;Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Flag=	will	be	set to	&lt;Y=.	Schools	will	use	additional	information	on	the	ISIR	to	determine	whether	students	qualify	for	Max	Pell,	Min	Pell,	or	a Calculated	Pell	Grant.	Actual	Pell	Grant	award	amounts	are	unique	to	individual	students	and	are	based	upon	and	limited by	the	student's	enrollment	intensity,	SAI,	COA,	and	Lifetime	Eligibility	Used	(LEU).	For	more	on	LEU,	see	Chapter	8	of	this volume.

## Maximum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility

HEA	Sec.	401(b)(1)(A)

## Poverty	Guidelines

The	Department	of	Health	and	Human	Services	(HHS)	annually	produces	poverty	guidelines	by	state	of	residence.	Use	the U.S.	Federal	Poverty	Guidelines	Used	to	Determine	Financial	Eligibility	for	Certain	Programs	for	the	prior-prior	tax	year (e.g.,	for	the	2025326	award	year,	use	the	2023	poverty	guideline)	by	state	of	legal	residence	to	determine	a	student9s eligibility	for	Max	or	Min	Pell.

## State	of	Legal	Residence

Dependent	student	state	of	legal	residence	is	the	reported	state	of	residence	of	their	parent(s),	if	reported.	Otherwise,	use the	student9s	reported	state	of	residence.	For	independent	students,	use	the	reported	state	of	residence	for	the	applicant.

For	independent	student	applicants	or	parents	of	dependent	student	applicants	who	do	not	have	a	reported	state	of	legal residence	or	whose	place	of	legal	residence	is	outside	the	U.S.,	use	the	poverty	estimates	for	the	contiguous	48	states.

## Required	to	File	a	Federal	Income	Tax	Return

Use	IRS	Publication	501	for	the	applicable	tax	year	to	determine	if	the	independent	applicant	or	dependent	student9s parent(s)	was	required	to	file	a	federal	tax	return.	If	tax	filing	status	is	known,	use	the	combination	of	reported	marital status,	tax	filing	status,	and	age	to	determine	if	they	were	required	to	file.

## Minimum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Criteria

This	section	describes	eligibility	criteria	to	qualify	for	a	Min	Pell	Grant	and	the	&lt;Minimum	Pell	Indicator=	value	that	you	will see	on	the	student9s	ISIR.

## Minimum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility

Calculated	Pell	Grant	(Eligibility	Based	on	SAI	and	COA)

If	the	&lt;Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Flag=	on	the	ISIR	is	set	to	&lt;Y=,	but	the	&lt;Max	Pell	Indicator=	and	&lt;Minimum	Pell	Indictor=	are blank,	the	student	may	be	eligible	for	a	calculated	Pell	Grant.

## Calculated	Pell	Grant	Order	of	Operations

Use	the	following	steps	to	determine	the	amount	of	a	calculated	Pell	Grant:

Step	1:

Subtract	the	student9s	calculated	SAI	from	the	award	year9s	published	Max	Pell	amount.

Step	2:

Compare	the	amount	from	Step	1	to	the	award	year9s	published	Min	Pell	amount.	If	Max Pell	minus	SAI	g	Min	Pell,	proceed	to	Step	3.	If	not,	the	student	is	not	eligible	for	a Calculated	Pell	Grant.

Step	3:

Round	the	result	from	Step	1	to	the	nearest	$5.

Step	4:

Compare	the	rounded	amount	from	Step	3	to	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA.	If	the rounded	amount	is	less	than	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA,	the	student	is	eligible	for	a Scheduled	Pell	Grant	Award	of	that	resulting	amount.	If	the	rounded	amount	is	greater than	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA,	the	student	is	eligible	for	a	Scheduled	Pell	Grant Award	equal	to	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	2,	Example	1:	Eligible	for	Calculated	Pell	Grant

A	student9s	calculated	SAI	is	1,004	and	the	Pell	COA	is	$10,000.	For	demonstration	purposes,	assume	the published	Max	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	$7,500.	The	published	Min	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	10%	of	the	Max	Pell, or	$750.	The	school	performs	the	steps	in	the	Calculated	Pell	Grant	process	to	determine	the	student9s	Scheduled Award.

Step	1:	Max	Pell	($7,500)	-	SAI	(1,004)	=	$6,496

Step	2:	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,496)	&gt;	Min	Pell	($750)

Step	3:	Round	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,496)	to	the	nearest	$5	=	$6,495

Step	4:	Rounded	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,495)	&lt;	Pell	Grant	COA	($10,000)

Since	the	calculated	Scheduled	Award	is	less	than	the	Pell	COA,	the	school	determines	that	the	student	is	eligible for	a	Scheduled	Award	of	$6,495.

If	the	student9s	calculated	Pell	Grant	is	greater	than	the	Min	Pell	amount/and/the	student9s	COA,	the	Scheduled	award	will be	the	same	value	as	the	student9s	COA	(not	rounded).

## Volume	7,	Chapter	2,	Example	2:	Eligible	for	Calculated	Pell	Grant,	Capped	at	COA

A	student9s	calculated	SAI	is	1,004	and	the	Pell	COA	is	$6,493.	For	demonstration	purposes,	assume	the	published Max	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	$7,500.	The	published	Min	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	10%	of	the	Max	Pell,	or	$750.

The	school	performs	the	steps	in	the	Calculated	Pell	Grant	process	to	determine	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award.

Step	1:	Max	Pell	($7,500)	-	SAI	(1,004)	=	$6,496

Step	2:	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,496)	&gt;	Min	Pell	($750)

Step	3:	Round	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,496)	to	the	nearest	$5	=	$6,495

Step	4:	Rounded	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($6,495)	&gt;	Pell	Grant	COA	($6,493)

Since	the	calculated	Scheduled	Award	is	greater	than	the	Pell	COA,	the	school	determines	the	student9s Scheduled	Award	must	be	capped	at	the	COA.	The	student	is	eligible	for	a	Scheduled	Award	of	$6,493.

If	the	student9s	calculated	Pell	Grant	is	less	than	the	published	Min	Pell	amount	for	the	award	year,	the	student	is	not eligible	for	a	calculated	Pell	Grant.	However,	the	student	may	still	meet	eligibility	requirements	for	Min	Pell	based	on	AGI, family	size,	state	of	residence,	and	poverty	guidelines,	described	previously.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	2,	Example	3:	Ineligible	for	Calculated	Pell	Grant

A	student9s	calculated	SAI	is	6,751	and	the	Pell	COA	is	$9,000.	For	demonstration	purposes,	assume	the	published Max	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	$7,500.	The	published	Min	Pell	for	the	award	year	is	10%	of	the	Max	Pell,	or	$750. The	school	performs	the	steps	in	the	Calculated	Pell	Grant	process	to	determine	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award.

Step	1:	Max	Pell	($7,500)	-	SAI	(6,751)	=	$749

Step	2:	Calculated	Pell	Grant	($749)	&lt;	Min	Pell	($750)

Since	this	student9s	Calculated	Pell	Grant	is	less	than	the	published	Min	Pell	for	the	award	year,	the	student	is	not eligible	for	a	Calculated	Pell	Grant.	However,	the	student	may	still	meet	eligibility	requirements	for	a	Min	Pell.

## Determining	the	Award	Year	for	Crossover	Pell	Awards

You	must	source	Pell	Grant	funds	from	the	award	year	to	which	the	payment	period	is	assigned.	When	awarding	Pell Grants	for	a	crossover	payment	period,	you	may	assign	the	payment	period	to	the	award	year	that	best	meets	the	needs of	your	students	and	maximizes	a	student9s	eligibility	over	the	two	award	years	in	which	the	crossover	payment	period occurs.	For	general	information	about	payment	periods,	see	Chapter	1	of	Volume	3,	and	for	more	detail	on	crossover payment	periods,	see	the	section	on	crossover	payment	periods	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume.

Crossover	payment	periods

34	CFR	690.64	3	Determining	the	award	year	for	a	Pell	Grant	crossover	payment	period

## Basic	Pell	Grant	Formulas

Except	for	subscription-based	programs	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	information	on	subscription-based	programs),	if	all coursework	is	offered	in	credit	hours	and	scheduled	to	be	completed	within	a	specific	time	frame,	the	program	generally can	be	considered	term-based.	Term-based	programs	can	have	either	standard	terms	or	nonstandard	terms.	Pell	Grants are	usually	calculated	differently	for	the	two	types	of	terms.	Standard-term	programs	may	be	treated	similarly	to nonstandard-term	programs	if	the	program	does	not	conform	to	a	traditional	academic	calendar	or	meet	certain	other conditions.	Regardless	of	whether	coursework	is	generally	offered	using	terms,	schools	always	have	the	option	of	treating a	program	as	a	non-term	program	for	Title	IV	purposes.	See	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	detailed	guidance	on	standard	term, nonstandard	term,	and	non-term	programs.

When	calculating	Pell	Grants,	you	must	generally	use	the	same	formula	for	all	years	in	a	student9s	program.	In	most cases,	a	program9s	academic	calendar	determines	the	formula	that	must	be	used	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	awards,	and	that formula	is	then	used	for	all	years	of	the	program.	However,	for	programs	offered	in	standard	terms	a	school	has	the	option of	choosing	between	different	Pell	formulas,	as	explained	later	in	this	chapter.	For	such	programs,	a	school	normally chooses	one	of	the	allowable	formulas	and	uses	that	same	formula	for	the	duration	of	the	program,	but	in	rare	cases	a school	may	have	reason	to	change	from	the	originally	selected	formula	to	a	different	allowable	formula.	Any	such	change in	Pell	formulas	for	standard-term	programs	can	only	be	made	at	the	beginning	of	a	new	award	year.

## Basic	Pell	Grant	formulas

## 34	CFR	690.63	3	Pell	Grant	formulas

Pell	Grant	Payments	by	Payment	Period

Pell	Grants	must	be	spread	out	in	disbursements	over	the	course	of	a	program	of	study	to	help	meet	the	student9s	costs	in each	payment	period.	The	payment	period	affects	when	Pell	funds	are	disbursed	and	the	exact	amount	to	be	disbursed. See	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	further	discussion	and	definitions	of	payment	periods.

A	student	who	doesn9t	enroll	in	one	of	the	payment	periods	of	a	program	won9t	receive	the	portion	of	their	award	for	that payment	period.	If	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	changes	in	the	next	payment	period,	the	annual	award	will	change and	the	disbursement	amount	for	the	payment	period	will	be	different.

Your	school	must	apply	its	federal	student	aid	full-time	enrollment	standards	consistently	to	all	students	enrolled	in	the same	program	of	study	for	all	Title	IV	purposes.	However,	your	school9s	academic	standard	may	differ	from	the	enrollment standard	used	by	the	financial	aid	office	for	Title	IV	purposes.	For	example,	your	school's	academic	policy	may	define	full time	as	six	hours	during	the	summer,	but	the	financial	aid	office	uses	12	hours	as	the	full-time	standard	for	all	terms, including	the	summer	term.	For	more	on	enrollment	status,	see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1.

## Chapter	3

## Pell	Grant	Enrollment	Intensity	and	Cost	of	Attendance

## Pell	Grants	and	Enrollment	Intensity

Enrollment	intensity	is	the	percentage	of	full-time	enrollment	at	which	a	student	is	enrolled,	rounded	to	the	nearest	whole percent.	For	example,	if	full-time	enrollment	is	12	credit	hours	and	the	student	is	enrolled	in	7	hours,	the	enrollment intensity	would	be	7	÷	12	×	100%	=	58.3%	(round	to	58%).

## Pell	Grant	Enrollment	Intensity	for	Term-Based	Programs

In	a	term-based	program,	academic	progress	is	always	measured	in	credit	hours	(or	an	equivalent	measure	in	a	direct assessment	program),	and	the	student9s	annual	award	depends	on	their	enrollment	intensity.	Your	school9s	standards	for full-time	enrollment	must	meet	the	minimum	regulatory	requirements,	which	are	discussed	in	detail	in	Volume	1,	Chapter 1	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

## Programs	Offered	in	Standard	Terms

For	Title	IV	purposes,	full-time	enrollment	for	programs	offered	in	standard	terms	is	defined	by	the	institution	and,	for undergraduate	students,	must	comprise	at	least	12	credit	hours.	Below	is	a	chart	of	enrollment	intensity	relative	to	full time,	assuming	the	school	defines	it	as	12	credit	hours	for	financial	aid	purposes. Enrollment	intensity	only	applies	to Pell	Grant	eligibility.	All	other	Title	IV	programs	use	enrollment	status	categories	(full-time,	three-quarter time,	half-time,	and	less-than-half-time).

| Credit Hours   | Enrollment Intensity Formula   | Enrollment Intensity   | Enrollment Status Equivalent   |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|

Note: Enrollment	intensity	cannot	exceed	100%	for	purposes	of	Pell	Grant	proration.

If	the	student	is	enrolled	less	than	half	time,	it	will	also	affect	the	cost	components	that	are	used	in	the	student9s	budget (see	Volume	3,	Chapter	2).	Note	that	schools	do	not	have	the	discretion	to	refuse	to	pay	an	otherwise	eligible	part-time student,	including	during	a	summer	term	or	intersession.

## Programs	Offered	in	Nonstandard	Terms

Full-time	enrollment	for	programs	offered	in	nonstandard	terms	is	determined	by	multiplying	the	number	of	weeks	in	each term	by	the	number	of	credit	hours	in	an	academic	year,	then	dividing	the	result	by	the	number	of	weeks	in	an	academic year.	The	full-time	enrollment	number	is	then	used	as	the	denominator	for	determining	enrollment	intensity.

For	example,	College	X	has	a	program	that	consists	of	four	8-week	terms.	College	X	defines	the	academic	year	as	40 quarter	hours	and	32	weeks	of	instructional	time.	College	X	determines	that	full-time	enrollment	is	10	credit	hours	per term	[(8	weeks	per	term	*	40	credit	hours)/32	weeks	of	instruction)].	Below	is	a	chart	of	enrollment	intensity,	relative	to 10	credit	hours	per	term	as	full-time.

| Quarter Credit Hours   | Enrollment Intensity Formula   | Enrollment Intensity   | Enrollment Status Equivalent   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 10 (or more)           | 10 ÷ 10 = 1.0                  | 100%                   | Full-Time                      |
| 9                      | 9 ÷ 10 = 0.90                  | 90%                    | Three-Quarter Time             |
| 8                      | 8 ÷ 10 = 0.80                  | 80%                    | Three-Quarter Time             |
| 7                      | 7 ÷ 10 = 0.70                  | 70%                    | Half-Time                      |
| 6                      | 6 ÷ 10 = 0.60                  | 60%                    | Half-Time                      |
| 5                      | 5 ÷ 10 = 0.50                  | 50%                    | Half-Time                      |
| 4                      | 4 ÷ 10 = 0.40                  | 40%                    | Less-than-Half-Time            |
| 3                      | 3 ÷ 10 = 0.30                  | 30%                    | Less-than-Half-Time            |
| 2                      | 2 ÷ 10 = 0.20                  | 20%                    | Less-than-Half-Time            |
| 1                      | 1 ÷ 10 = 0.10                  | 10%                    | Less-than-Half-Time            |

Note: Full-time	enrollment	for	programs	offered	in	nonstandard	terms	may	differ	from	program	to	program	and	even	from term	to	term,	as	it	is	based	on	the	number	of	weeks	in	each	term,	the	number	of	credit	hours	in	an	academic	year,	and the	number	of	weeks	in	an	academic	year.

Pell	Grant	Enrollment	Intensity	for	Clock-Hour	or	Non-Term-Based	Programs

Students	enrolled	in	clock-hour	or	non-term-based	programs	are	considered	to	be	enrolled	full-time	for	Pell	Grant purposes.	See	Chapter	4	of	this	volume	for	additional	discussion	of	enrollment	intesity	for	clock-hour	and	non-term-based programs.

## Pell	Grant	Enrollment	Intensity	for	a	Consortium	Program

The	enrollment	intensity	of	a	student	attending	more	than	one	school	under	a	consortium	agreement	is	based	on	all	the courses	taken	that	apply	to	the	degree	or	certificate	at	the	home	school.	The	disbursing	school	may	have	to	make	some adjustments	if	the	coursework	at	the	other	school	is	measured	in	different	units.

Below	are	examples	of	calculating	enrollment	intensity	for	students	enrolled	in	regular	coursework	at	their	home institution	and	coursework	offered	at	another	institution	through	a	consortium	agreement.	The	examples	describe	how	to calculate	enrollment	intensity	when	the	units	of	enrollment	are	different	(i.e.,	semester	hours	at	the	home	school	and quarter	hours	at	the	consortium	institution).

## Volume	7,	Chapter	3,	Example	1:	Quarter	Hours	Converted	to	Semester	Hours

A	student	is	taking	six semester hours	at	their	home	school	and	nine quarter hours	at	a	different	school	under	a consortium	agreement.	To	determine	their	enrollment	intensity,	the	home	school	needs	to	convert	the	hours	at the	host	school	into semester hours.

Because	a	quarter	hour	is	about	two-thirds	of	a	semester	hour,	the	home	school	multiplies	the	number	of	quarter hours	by	two-thirds:

- 9	quarter	hours	x	2/3	=	6	semester	hours

Then	the	hours	taken	at	both	schools	can	be	added	together:

6	semester	hours	(home	school)	+	6	semester	hours	(host	school)	=	12	semester	hours

## Volume	7,	Chapter	3,	Example	2:	Semester	Hours	Converted	to	Quarter	Hours

A	student	is	taking	nine	quarter	hours	at	their	home	institution	and	six	semester	hours	at	a	different	institution.	To determine	their	enrollment	intensity,	the	home	school	needs	to	convert	the	hours	at	the	host	school	into	quarter hours.

Because	a	semester	hour	is	about	one	and	one-half	of	a	quarter	hour,	the	home	school	multiplies	the	number	of quarter	hours	by	1.5:

6	semester	hours	x	1.5	=	9	quarter	hours

Then,	the	hours	taken	at	both	schools	can	be	added	together:

- 9	quarter	hours	(home	school)	+	9	quarter	hours	(host	school)	=	18	quarter	hours

## Students	Enrolled	in	Only	Correspondence	Courses

Students	enrolled	in	programs	of	correspondence	study	are	considered	to	be	enrolled	no	more	than	half	time	(the equivalent	of	50%	enrollment	intensity),	even	if	they	are	enrolled	in	enough	coursework	to	be	full	time.	However,	if	the correspondence	study	is	combined	with	regular	coursework,	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	might	be	more	than	half time	(see	section	below	for	additional	information).

A	student	enrolled	only	in	a	non-term	correspondence	program	always	has	their	award	calculated	based	on	50% enrollment	intensity.	For	a	student	enrolled	in	a	term-based	correspondence	program,	your	school	must	determine whether	the	student	is	enrolled	half	time	(six	or	more	credit	hours	in	a	term)	or	less	than	half	time	(fewer	than	six	credit hours	in	a	term).	Special	rules	are	used	to	determine	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	when	the	student	is	enrolled	in	a combination	of	regular	and	correspondence	coursework.

Students	Enrolled	in	a	Combination	of	Regular	and	Correspondence	Courses

If	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	non-correspondence	study	program,	but	correspondence	coursework	is	combined	with	regular coursework,	the	correspondence	courses	must	meet	the	following	criteria	to	be	considered	in	determining	the	student9s enrollment	intensity:

- The	courses	must	apply	toward	the	student9s	degree	or	certificate	or	must	be	remedial	work	to	help	the	student	in their	course	of	study.
- The	courses	must	be	completed	during	the	period	required	for	the	student9s	regular	coursework	(e.g.,	a	term).
- The	amount	of	correspondence	work	counted	can9t	be	more	than	the	number	of	credit	hours	of	regular	coursework	in which	the	student	is	enrolled	(although	a	student	taking	at	least	a	half-time	load	of	correspondence	courses	must	be paid	as	at	least	a	half-time	student,	regardless	of	the	credit	hours	of	regular	coursework).

This	chart	assumes	that	the	school	defines	full-time	enrollment	as	12	credit	hours	per	term,	and	half-time	enrollment	as six	credit	hours	per	term.

|   Regular Work |   Correspondence Work |   Adjusted Total Coursework | Enrollment Intensity   |
|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|
|              3 |                     3 |                           6 | 50%                    |
|              3 |                     6 |                           6 | 50%                    |
|              3 |                     9 |                           6 | 50%                    |
|              6 |                     3 |                           9 | 75%                    |
|              6 |                     4 |                          10 | 83%                    |
|              6 |                     6 |                          12 | 100%                   |
|              6 |                     2 |                           8 | 67%                    |
|              2 |                     6 |                           6 | 50%                    |
|              3 |                     2 |                           5 | 42%                    |

As	you	can	see	in	the	second	and	third	rows	of	the	table,	the	number	of	correspondence	hours	counted	in	the	total	course load	was	adjusted	so	that	the	correspondence	hours	never	exceeded	the	regular	hours	taken.	Note	that,	in	the	second	to last	row	of	the	table,	the	student	is	eligible	for	payment	based	on	half-time	(50%	enrollment	intensity)	in	correspondence courses,	because	not	all	the	correspondence	work	can	be	counted	toward	enrollment	intensity.

## Determining	Enrollment	Intensity	Using	Credit	Hour	Equivalencies

For	students	enrolled	in	direct	assessment	programs	and	students	with	intellectual	disabilities	enrolled	in	comprehensive transition	and	postsecondary	(CTP)	programs,	enrollment	intensity	can	be	calculated	using	credit	hour	&lt;equivalencies= rather	than	credit	hours.

For	direct	assessment	programs,	schools	must	develop	a	methodology,	consistent	with	the	requirements	of	the	school9s accrediting	agency	or	state,	to	reasonably	equate	each	class	or	competency	in	the	direct	assessment	program	to	either credit	hour	or	clock	hour	equivalencies.	For	more	information,	see	Volume	2,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

Enrollment	intensity	for	students	with	intellectual	disabilities	enrolled	in	CTP	programs	may	also	be	determined	using credit	hour	equivalencies.	These	equivalent	credits,	earned	from	audited	courses	and	other	normally	noncredit	activities undertaken	as	part	of	a	program	for	students	with	disabilities,	may	be	awarded	for	purposes	of	determining	enrollment intensity.	For	more	detail,	see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

## Enrollment	Intensity	for	Cooperative	Education

In	a	cooperative	education	program,	your	school	assesses	the	work	to	be	performed	by	the	student	and	determines	the equivalent	academic	course	load.	The	student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	based	on	the	equivalent	academic	course	load.

## Academic	Calendar	and	Enrollment	Intensity	Changes

Because	the	academic	calendar	for	a	program	determines	which	Pell	formula	you	use,	you	need	to	review	the	conditions for	the	use	of	each	formula	if	the	calendar	for	the	program	changes.	This	is	particularly	true	if	you	are	using	Formulas	1 and	2,	which	have	the	most	restrictive	conditions.

If	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity	changes	during	the	year,	your	school	may	have	to	recalculate	the	student9s	Pell	Grant payment	based	on	the	new	enrollment	intensity.	We9ll	discuss	when	a	school	is	required	to	recalculate	a	student9s	Pell Grant	payment	due	to	a	change	in	enrollment	intensity	in	Chapter	7	of	this	volume.

## Enrollment	intensity	changes

## 34	CFR	690.80(b)

## Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance

The	types	of	costs	included	in	the	Pell	Grant	cost	of	attendance	are	the	same	as	those	for	the	other	Title	IV	programs; however,	the	value	of	each	component	in	the	Pell	Grant	COA	is	always	based	on	the	costs	for	a full-time	student	for	a full	academic	year .	See	Volume	3,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	a	full	discussion	of	cost	of	attendance	and allowable	costs.

For	Pell,	costs	for	programs	or	enrollment	periods	longer	or	shorter	than	an	academic	year	must	be	prorated	so	that	they are	the	costs	for	one	full	academic	year.	This	is	true	for	both	parts	of	the	academic	year	definition:	if	either	the	number	of weeks	or	the	number	of	clock/credit	hours	differs	from	the	academic	year	standard,	the	costs	must	be	prorated	to determine	the	full-time,	full-year	Pell	budget.

The	need	to	prorate	Pell	costs	is	most	likely	to	occur	in	these	situations:

- A	term-based	program	that	provides	fewer	weeks	of	instructional	time	than	the	minimum	number	of	weeks	of instructional	time	in	an	academic	year;
- A	non-term	program	that	provides	less	than	24	semester	hours,	36	quarter	hours,	or	900	clock	hours	and/or	provides fewer	weeks	of	instructional	time	than	the	minimum	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	an	academic	year;	or
- A	program	that	is	longer	than	an	academic	year,	where	the	costs	for	the	entire	program	are	charged	at	the	beginning

of	the	program.

There	are	two	ways	to	prorate	Pell	costs,	as	shown	in	the	following	examples.	Examples	3	and	4	are	based	on	a	program that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year.	Example	5	shows	how	costs	are	prorated	when	they	are	charged	for	a	program	that is	longer	than	an	academic	year.	Note	that	prorating	the	COA	usually	does	not	affect	the	amount	of	Pell	Grant	the	student receives.	However,	you9re	required	to	report	the	full-time,	full-year	Pell	budget	when	reporting	disbursements	to	the Common	Origination	and	Disbursement	System	(COD).

## Volume	7,	Chapter	3,	Example	3:	Prorating	Total	Costs	by	Lesser	of	Two	Fractions

You	may	take	the	student9s	entire	COA	(tuition	and	fees,	housing	and	food,	etc.)	and	multiply	it	by	the	lesser	of the	two	fractions	that	represent	the	length	of	the	academic	year.	One	fraction	is	based	on	credit	or	clock	hours and	the	other	is	based	on	weeks	of	instructional	time,	as	shown	in	this	example.

Let9s	use	the	example	of	a	program	that	charges	$10,500,	awards	18	semester	credits,	and	is	completed	by	most full-time	students	within	20	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Credit/clock	hours	in	academic	year	definition	(24)	÷	Credit/clock	hours	awarded	(18)

OR

Weeks	in	academic	year	definition	(30)	÷	Weeks	provided	(20)

Since	the	fraction	using	credit	hours	is	the	lesser	fraction,	the	program	cost	of	$10,500	is	multiplied	by	24/18	to find	the	full-year	Pell	cost.

$10,500	x	(24/18)	=	$14,000

The	full-time	cost	is	$14,000.

Note: If	one	of	the	fractions	is	equal	to	one,	for	instance,	if	the	program	awards	24	credit	hours,	then	the	prorated cost	is	the	same	as	the	original	COA.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	3,	Example	4:	Prorating	Academic	Costs	and	Living	Expenses	Separately

As	an	alternative,	you	can	separately	prorate	the	costs	associated	with	credit	or	clock	hours	(tuition	and	fees, books	and	supplies,	loan	fees)	and	the	costs	associated	with	weeks	of	instructional	time	(housing	and	food, miscellaneous	expenses,	disability	expenses,	transportation,	dependent	care,	study	abroad,	reasonable	costs associated	with	employment	as	part	of	a	cooperative	education	program).	Using	our	earlier	example	of	a	program lasting	20	weeks	and	awarding	18	credit	hours,	and	specifying	that	the	student9s	tuition,	books,	supplies,	etc., come	to	$4,500	and	living	expenses	amount	to	$6,000,	the	calculation	would	look	like	this:

$4,500	x	(24/18)	=	$6,000

$6,000	x	(30/20)	=	$9,000

In	this	example,	the	student9s	Pell	COA	is	the	sum	of	the	two	prorated	costs,	or	$15,000.

Volume	7,	Chapter	3,	Example	5:	Prorating	Costs	for	a	Non-term	Program	Longer	Than	an	Academic Year

You	must	also	prorate	costs	if	they	are	charged	for	a	period	longer	than	an	academic	year.	You	may	use	either	of the	proration	methods	shown	in	Examples	3	and	4.	We9ll	use	the	example	of	a	program	awarding	1,000	clock hours	and	providing	40	weeks	of	instructional	time.	Let9s	assume	that	the	school	uses	the	regulatory	minimums and	defines	the	academic	year	as	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks.	The	total	costs	over	the	40	weeks,	including tuition	and	living	expenses,	are	$5,900.	If	we	use	the	method	in	Example	3,	this	amount	must	be	prorated	by	the lesser	of	the	following	two	fractions:

Credit/clock	hours	in	academic	year	definition	(900)	÷	Credit/clock	hours	awarded	(1,000)

OR

Weeks	in	academic	year	definition	(26)	÷	Weeks	provided	(40)

The	lesser	of	the	two	fractions	is	the	one	based	on	weeks	(26/40).	Multiply	the	total	program	cost	by	this	fraction to	determine	the	Pell	costs	for	a	full	academic	year:

$5,900	x	(26/40)	=	$3,835

If	the	student	is	in	a	category	where	costs	are	limited,	such	as	less-than-half-time	enrollment,	those	costs	that	are allowable	must	be	based	on	costs	for	a	full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year.	For	instance,	the	tuition component	of	the	Pell	COA	for	a	less-than-half-time	student	must	be	based	on	the	tuition	costs	that	would	be incurred	by	a	full-time	student	attending	a	full	academic	year.

Less	Than	Half	Time	Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance

As	stated	above,	the	value	of	each	component	in	the	Pell	Grant	COA	is	always	based	on	the	costs	for	a full-time	student for	a	full	academic	year .	However,	students	enrolled	less	than	half	time	may	only	have	certain	components	included	in their	COA.	You	may	not	include	either	(1)	miscellaneous	personal	expenses	or	(2)	housing	and	food	if	the	student	has exhausted	their	less-than-half-time	housing	and	food	allowance	(three	semesters	or	equivalent	in	total,	no	more	than	two of	which	may	be	consecutive	at	any	one	school).	See	Volume	3,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	a	full	discussion	of cost	of	attendance	and	allowable	costs	for	less-time-half-time	students.

The	following	examples	use	the	cost	of	attendance	described	below	and	demonstrate	how	a	student9s	Scheduled	Pell Grant	award	may	differ,	based	on	a	less-than-half-time	enrollment	intensity.	For	demonstration	purposes,	assume	the student	has	exhausted	their	less-than-half-time	housing	and	food	allowance	at	the	institution.

The	student	is	eligible	for	Max	Pell,	which	is	$7,500	for	demonstration	purposes.	As	a	full-time	student,	the	Pell	Grant	COA ($9,000)	is	greater	than	the	Pell	Grant	amount	($7,500),	so	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500.	However,	since	the less-than-half-time	Pell	Grant	COA	($3,500)	is	less	than	the	Pell	Grant	amount	($7,500),	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	as a	less-than-half-time	student	is	capped	at	$3,500.	See	&lt;Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	4=	for	a	demonstration	of	how	to determine	the	student9s	annual	award,	based	on	less-than-half-time	enrollment	intensity.

## Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance	for	Cooperative	Education

If	a	student	has	a	co-op	job	for	the	first	term,	the	tuition	and	fees	for	that	period	can	be	prorated	over	the	full	academic year	for	the	program	(which	must	include	at	least	24	semester/trimester	hours,	36	quarter	credit	hours,	or	900	clock hours,	as	well	as	30	weeks	of	instructional	time,	or,	for	clock-hour	programs,	26	weeks).	This	prorated	amount	is	then added	to	the	other	COA	components	to	arrive	at	the	total	cost	for	a	full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year.

For	the	rest	of	the	year,	your	school	can	either	use	the	COA	with	the	projected	amount	or	can	recalculate	the	student9s tuition	and	fees	at	the	end	of	the	first	term	to	determine	a	new	COA	for	the	remaining	payment	periods.	This	decision must	be	consistent	with	your	school9s	overall	policy	on	recalculating	for	changes	in	a	student9s	costs.	Note	that	the	COA can	also	include	employment-related	expenses.

## Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance	for	a	Consortium	Program

A	student	receiving	a	Pell	Grant	for	attendance	at	two	schools	through	a	consortium	agreement	may	have	costs	from	both schools	at	the	same	time.	The	student9s	COA	is	calculated	in	the	same	way	as	for	a	student	taking	classes	at	only	one school.	The	student9s	charges	for	tuition	and	fees	and	books	and	supplies	at	the	consortium	schools	must	be	combined into	a	single	charge	for	a	full	academic	year	for	purposes	of	the	Pell	calculation.

The	school	paying	the	student	may	choose	to	use	actual	charges	for	the	student,	which	would	simply	be	the	sum	of	the actual	charges	at	each	school.	Of	course,	if	the	student	isn9t	attending	full-time,	your	school	will	have	to	prorate	these tuition	and	fees	and	books	and	supplies	charges	so	that	they	are	the	correct	amounts	for	a	full-time,	full-year	student.

If	the	disbursing	school	uses	average	charges,	then	the	average	full-time	charges	at	each	of	the	schools	must	be	prorated and	combined.	If	the	student	is	taking	a	full-time	load	at	each	school,	the	full-time	tuition	and	fees	charges	for	an academic	year	at	each	school	can	be	averaged	to	determine	the	tuition	and	fee	cost.	However,	if	the	student	is	taking	an unequal	course	load,	the	disbursing	school	must	prorate	the	charges	based	on	the	number	of	hours	the	student	is	taking at	each	school.

## Chapter	4

## Calculating	Annual	Awards	Using	Pell	Grant	Formulas

## Fractions	and	Rounding

Use	the	following	rules	on	fractions	and	rounding	along	with	Pell	Formulas	1-5	(discussed	later)	to	properly	calculate	and award	Pell	Grants.

## Fractions

When	using	fractions,	be	careful	to	multiply	first,	and	then	divide	to	avoid	an	incorrect	result.	For	example,	the	correct way	to	prorate	a	$2,150	Scheduled	Award	for	a	payment	period	that	is	a	nonstandard	term	of	10	weeks	of	instructional time,	for	a	program	that	has	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	is	to	multiply	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the	number	of	weeks	of instructional	time	in	the	term,	then	divide	by	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	academic	year	or	($2,150	x 10)	÷	30	=	$716.67.

In	this	case,	if	you	were	to	first	divide	the	fraction	consisting	of	the	weeks	in	the	payment	period	over	the	weeks	in	the academic	year	to	get	a	decimal	(10	÷	30	=	0.333333...)	and	then	round	the	decimal	either	down	(0.33)	or	up	(0.34), multiplying	that	decimal	by	the	Scheduled	Award	amount	would	result	in	a	number	that9s	too	low	(0.33	x	$2,150	= $709.50)	or	too	high	(0.34	x	$2,150	=	$731.00).

## Rounding

The	Common	Origination	and	Disbursement	System	(COD)	accepts	cents	and	whole	dollar	amounts	in	payment	amounts for	Pell.	If	your	school	disburses	in	whole	dollar	amounts,	you	may	round	up	if	the	decimal	is	0.50	or	higher,	or	round	down if	it's	less	than	0.50.	When	rounding	for	a	student	expected	to	be	enrolled	for	more	than	one	payment	period	in	the	award year,	alternate	rounding	up	and	down,	unless	a	different	Pell	award	amount	is	calculated	for	the	following	term	(for example,	when	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity	changes).	In	this	case,	the	alternate	rounding	restarts	and	you	may	round up	for	two	consecutive	terms.	Your	policy	on	rounding	must	be	applied	equally	to	all	students.

As	an	example,	consider	a	student	who	is	enrolled	full	time	in	a	program	offered	in	a	traditional	academic	calendar consisting	of	fall	and	spring	semesters.	The	student's	full-time	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,005.	Under	Pell	Formula	1	(as described	later	in	this	chapter),	the	student's	full-time	payment	for	each	of	the	two	terms	(fall	and	spring)	is	$3,502.50. Using	the	rounding	rule	stated	above,	you	would	round	the	student's	fall	payment	up	to	$3,503,	and	round	the	spring payment	down	to	$3,502.

Finally,	when	calculating	eligibility	using	Pell	Formula	2	or	3,	you	may	round	the	annual	award	to	the	nearest	whole	dollar before	determining	the	disbursement	amounts	for	each	term.	See	&lt;Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	9=	for	a	demonstration of	this	rounding	rule.

Important: These	rounding	rules	do	not	apply	if	the	amount	disbursed	would	exceed	the	student9s	Pell	Grant eligibility	for	the	award	year	or	place	the	student9s	Lifetime	Eligibility	Used	over	600%.

Pell	Formula	1:	Credit-Hour	Programs	Using	Standard	Terms	With	At	Least	30	Weeks	of	Instructional	Time

To	use	Pell	Formula	1,	the	program	must:

- Measure	academic	progress	in	credit	hours;
- Be	offered	in	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters;
- Define	full-time	enrollment	for	each	term	in	the	award	year	as	at	least	12	credit	hours;	and
- Use	an	academic	calendar	providing	at	least	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	that	meets	either	of	the	following	sets	of requirements:
- 1.	 The	academic	calendar	consists	of	two	semesters	or	trimesters	(fall	and	spring)	or	three	quarters	(fall,	winter, and	spring),	none	of	which	overlap	any	other	term	in	the	program	(including	a	summer	term,	which	need	not meet	the	definition	of	a	standard	term); or
- 2.	 The	academic	calendar	consists	of	any	two	semesters	or	trimesters	or	any	three	quarters	where4
- The	school	starts	the	terms	for	different	cohorts	of	students	on	a	periodic	basis	(e.g.,	monthly);
- The	program	is	offered	exclusively	in	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters;	and
- Students	are	not	allowed	to	be	enrolled	simultaneously	in	overlapping	terms	and	must	stay	with	the	cohort in	which	they	start	unless	they	withdraw	from	a	term	(or	skip	a	term)	and	re-enroll	in	a	subsequent	term.

For	Formula	1,	the	term	is	the	payment	period,	and	you	divide	the	student9s	annual	award	by	the	number	of	terms	in	the program9s	academic	year.	You	can	combine	modules	into	a	standard	term	that	meets	the	requirements	for	Formula	1. (See	the	discussion	under	"Combining	modules	into	a	standard	term"	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	examples.)	You	must	use the	same	formula	for	a	program	for	all	payment	periods	in	an	award	year.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	1:	Traditional	Academic	Calendar

In	Formula	1,	the	annual	award	is	simply	divided	by	the	number	of	terms	in	the	fall	through	spring	at	a	school	with a	traditional	academic	calendar.

| Annual Pell Award                     | $2,500    | $2,500    | $2,500    |

Since	the	student	is	enrolled	full	time	in	either	two	semesters	or	three	quarters,	they	will	have	received	a	full Scheduled	Award	at	the	end	of	the	spring	term.	If	the	student	enrolls	in	a	summer	term,	they	may	be	eligible	to receive	further	Pell	funds	from	the	Year-Round	Pell	provision.	See	the	Year-Round	Pell	Grant	section	in	Chapter	5 of	this	volume.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	2:	Nontraditional	Academic	Calendar

A	school	offers	a	program	that	has	an	academic	year	of	36	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	36	quarter	hours	and	is offered	exclusively	in	quarters.	A	new	cohort	of	students	starts	a	quarter	on	the	first	workday	of	each	month,	and a	student	is	not	allowed	to	take	courses	in	overlapping	terms	outside	that	student9s	cohort.

Any	three	quarters	of	the	program	provide	at	least	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	since	each	quarter	is	12	weeks of	instructional	time	in	length.	To	be	full	time,	a	student	must	be	enrolled	in	at	least	12	quarter	hours	each	term.	A student	enrolled	full	time	in	any	three	quarters	would	have	their	Scheduled	Award	divided	by	3	to	determine	their disbursement	for	each	payment	period.

- Full-time	definition:	30	weeks	of	instruction;	12	credits	per	term
- Scheduled	Pell	Grant	award:	$7,500

Disbursement	Schedule

|                                       | Term 1    | Term 2    | Term 3    |

| Credit Hours (Enrollment Intensity %) | 12 (100%) | 15 (100%) | 12 (100%) |
| Annual Pell Award                     | $2,500    | $2,500    | $2,500    |

If	the	student	enrolls	in	a	fourth	term,	they	may	be	eligible	to	receive	further	Pell	funds	from	the	Year-Round	Pell provision.	See	the	Year-Round	Pell	Grant	section	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	3:	Enrollment	Intensity	Change

- Full-time	definition:	30	weeks	of	instruction;	12	semester	credits	per	term
- Scheduled	Pell	Grant	award:	$7,500

## Disbursement	Schedule	(Full-time)

|                                       | Fall      | Spring    |

| Annual Pell Award                     | $3,750    | $3,750    |

If	the	same	student	enrolls	in	12	credits	in	the	fall	and	but	reduces	their	spring	enrollment	to	9	credits	before	the start	of	the	spring	semester,	their	spring	payment	will	be	based	on	75%	enrollment	intensity	for	spring,	rather than	the	full-time	Scheduled	Award.

- Full-time	Scheduled	Pell	Grant	award:	$7,500

Disbursement	Schedule	(Less	than	full-time)

| Annual Pell Award                     | $3,750    | ($7,500 x 75%) ÷ 2 = $2,812.50 (which may be rounded to $2,813) |

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	4:	Less-than-half-time	Enrollment	and	Pell	Grant	COA

A	student	plans	to	enroll	full	time	in	the	fall	and	spring	semesters.	The	school	determines	the	student9s disbursement	schedule,	shown	below.

- Full-time	definition:	30	weeks	of	instruction;	12	credits	per	term
- FT	Pell	Grant	COA:	$9,000
- FT	Scheduled	Pell	Grant	award:	$7,500

Semester	Disbursement	Schedule

|                                       | Fall      | Spring    |
|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Credit Hours (Enrollment Intensity %) | 12 (100%) | 15 (100%) |
| Annual Pell Award                     | $3,750    | $3,750    |

Before	the	start	of	the	fall	semester,	the	student	decides	they	need	to	reduce	their	planned	enrollment	to	3 credits	in	each	term,	which	is	less	than	half	time.	The	school	determines	the	student9s	less	than	half-time	(LTHT) Pell	Grant	COA	is	$3,500,	based	on	the	restrictions	on	which	COA	components	can	be	included	for	a	less-than-halftime	student.	See	&lt;Less	Than	Half	Time	Pell	Grant	Cost	of	Attendance=	in	Chapter	3	of	this	volume	for	further discussion	of	this	topic.

- LTHT	Pell	Grant	COA:	$3,500
- LTHT	Scheduled	Pell	Grant	award:	$3,500

Since	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	limited	by	the	student9s	LTHT	Pell	Grant	COA,	the	school	uses	the	capped Scheduled	Award	as	the	starting	point	for	prorating	the	award	by	the	enrollment	intensity.

After	completing	3	credits	in	the	fall,	the	student	decides	they	can	handle	an	extra	course	in	the	spring	semester and	enrolls	in	6	credits.	Since	the	student	is	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	the	spring,	the	school	uses	the	full-time, full-year	Pell	Grant	COA	to	determine	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	($7,500).

Note: In	this	example,	the	student9s	total	annual	award	based	on	less-than-half-time	enrollment	in	the	fall (25%	enrollment	intensity)	and	half-time	enrollment	in	the	spring	(50%	enrollment	intensity)	is	$2,313 ($438	in	the	fall	plus	$1,875	in	the	spring).	COD	will	only	accept	one	Pell	COA	and	one	annual	award	for the	award	year.	Schools	should	report	the	larger	COA	and	total	annual	award	to	COD	to	calculate	the Scheduled	Award	and	Pell	LEU	correctly.

## Formula	1	Alternate	Calculation

If	a	standard-term	program	meets	the	requirements	to	use	Formula	1	or	Formula	2,	you	have	the	option	of	dividing	the annual	award	by	the	number	of	all	the	terms	(including	the	summer	term)	in	the	award	year.

Pell	Formula	2:	Standard-Term	Programs	with	Less	Than	30	Weeks	in	the	Fall	Through	Spring

The	regulations	provide	an	option	for	standard-term	programs	whose	fall	through	spring	terms	provide	less	than	30	weeks of	instructional	time.	Formula	2	may	be	advantageous	for	your	summer	term	calculations	as	it	allows	you	to	pay	the	same Pell	amount	for	the	summer	term	as	you	would	for	a	traditional	fall	through	spring	term.	You	may	use	Formula	2	if	the program:

- Has	an	academic	calendar	that	consists	of	two	semesters	or	trimesters	(in	the	fall	through	the	following	spring)	or three	quarters	(in	the	fall,	winter,	and	spring);
- Does	not	have	overlapping	terms;	and
- Measures	progress	in	credit-hours	and	defines	full-time	enrollment	for	each	term	in	the	award	year	as	at	least	12 credit-hours.

Note: Examples	use	fictional	maximum	($7,500)	and	minimum	($750)	Pell	Grant	award	amounts	for demonstration	purposes	only.	Award	amounts	in	examples	in	this	volume	should	not	be	used	in	packaging	Pell Grants	for	the	2025-26	award	year.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	5:	Calculation	for	Standard	Terms	With	Fall	Through	Spring	Terms	Less Than	30	Weeks

A	school	offers	a	program	with	a	14-week	fall	term,	15-week	spring	term,	and	10-week	summer	term.	The	school defines	its	academic	year	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks.	Because	the	fall	and	spring	terms	provide	less than	the	minimum	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	for	an	academic	year,	a	student9s	full-time	Scheduled	Award must	be	prorated	based	on	the	number	of	weeks	in	the	academic	calendar	to	determine	the	annual	Pell	Grant award.	The	annual	Pell	Grant	award	is	then	divided	by	the	number	of	terms	in	the	fall	through	spring.

- Scheduled	Award:	$7,500
- Weeks	in	the	academic	year	(fall	through	spring):	29
- Annual	award:	($7,500	*	29)	÷	30	=	$7,250

Disbursement	Schedule

|                                       | Fall (14 weeks)   | Spring (15 weeks)   |

| Credit Hours (Enrollment Intensity %) | 12 (100%)         | 15 (100%)           |
| Annual Pell Award                     | $3,625            | $3,625              |

The	total	disbursed	for	this	student	($7,250)	is	less	than	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	($7,500).	This	student may	be	able	to	receive	a	disbursement	comprising	the	remainder	of	their	Scheduled	Award	during	the	summer term.	Additionally,	the	student	may	be	eligible	to	receive	funds	from	Year-Round	Pell	provisions.	See	the	&lt;YearRound	Pell	Grant=	section	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume.

## Formula	2	Alternate	Calculation

Under	Formula	2,	you	can	perform	the	same	alternate	calculation	as	performed	under	Formula	1	if	the	weeks	of instructional	time	in	the	defined	academic	year	are	the	same	as	the	total	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	all	the terms	in	the	award	year.

Pell	Formula	3:	General	Formula	for	Any	Term-Based	Program

Any	term-based	program	may	use	this	formula	for	Pell	calculations,	but	you	must	use	this	formula	for	a	term-based program	that	does	not	qualify	for	Formulas	1	or	2	(for	instance,	a	program	that	uses	only	nonstandard	terms).	To	calculate the	payment	for	the	term,	you	must	prorate	the	Scheduled	Award.

In	Formula	3,	the	Scheduled	Pell	Award	is	prorated	based	on	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	each	term	in	the academic	year	to	determine	the	annual	Pell	Grant	award	by	term.	Unlike	Formula	1,	the	annual	award	isn9t	simply	divided evenly	by	the	number	of	terms.	And,	unlike	Formula	2	where	you	prorate	the	Scheduled	Award	based	on	the	combined total	number	of	weeks	in	the	fall	through	spring	terms,	Formula	3	requires	you	to	prorate	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the number	of	weeks	in	each	specific	term,	using	the	following	formula:

(Scheduled	Award	x	Weeks	in	the	Term)	÷	Total	Weeks	in	the	Academic	Year

Note: Examples	use	fictional	maximum	($7,500)	and	minimum	($750)	Pell	Grant	award	amounts	for demonstration	purposes	only.	Award	amounts	in	examples	in	this	volume	should	not	be	used	in	packaging	Pell Grants	for	the	2025-26	award	year.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	6:	Payments	for	Standard	Terms	of	Equal	Length	and	Less	Than	30 Weeks

For	example,	a	college	has	a	semester-based	program	with	a	2-term	academic	calendar	that	comprises	28	weeks of	instructional	time.	The	program9s	academic	year	is	defined	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional time.

- Scheduled	Award:	$7,500

## Disbursement	Schedule

|                                       | Fall (14 weeks)    | Spring (14 weeks)   |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Credit Hours (Enrollment Intensity %) | 12 (100%)          | (100%)              |
| Calculation                           | ($7,500 x 14) ÷ 30 | ($7,500 x 14)       |
| Annual Pell Award                     | $3,500             | $3,500              |

A	single	disbursement	for	a	payment	period	generally	cannot	be	for	more	than	50%	of	the	annual	award.	If	the disbursement	amount	for	one	term	would	be	more	than	50%	of	the	annual	award,	you	must	generally	make	the payment	in	at	least	two	disbursements	in	that	payment	period	regardless	of	whether	the	term	is	a	standard	term or	a	nonstandard	term.	You	may	disburse	the	remaining	portion	of	the	payment	for	the	term	that	exceeds	50%	of the	annual	award	once	the	student	has	completed	half	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s academic	year	definition.

However,	if	the	disbursement	for	the	payment	period	results	in	more	than	half	of	the	annual	award	and	occurs after	half	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	of	the	academic	year	have	passed	during	the	payment	period,	you	can make	a	disbursement	of	the	full	payment	for	the	payment	period.

Single	Disbursement	May	Not	Exceed	50%	of	Award

## 34	CFR	690.63(f)

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	7:	Disbursing	More	Than	Half	the	Annual	Award	and	the	50% Requirement

For	example,	consider	a	program	that	must	use	Formula	3	and	that	has	three	terms	with	17,	14,	and	6	weeks	of instructional	time.	The	program's	academic	year	is	defined	as	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	24	semester hours.

A	student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	50%	in	all	three	terms.

- Scheduled	Pell	Award:	$7,500
- Annual	Pell	Award:	$7,500	x	50%	=	$3,750
- Disbursement	Formula:	(Annual	Award	x	Weeks	in	the	Term)	÷	Total	Weeks	in	the	Academic	Year

Disbursement	Schedule

| Calculation   | ($3,750 x 17) ÷ 30                | ($3,750 x 14) ÷ 30   | ($3,750 x 6) ÷ 30   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Disbursement  | 1st Disb.: $1,875 2nd Disb.: $250 | $1,750               | $750                |

For	the	first	term,	you	may	disburse	15/30	of	the	student9s	award	at	the	beginning	of	the	term	and	the	final	2/30 only	after	the	15th	week	of	instructional	time	in	the	term.	However,	if	the	student	establishes	eligibility	in	the	16th week	of	the	term,	you	can	make	a	disbursement	of	17/30	of	the	annual	award	at	that	time.	The	student9s	award for	the	second	and	third	terms	may	each	be	disbursed	in	a	single	disbursement.

## Enrollment	Intensity	Standards	for	Nonstandard	Terms

If	you	are	using	Formula	3	for	a	program	that	contains	standard	terms,	the	minimum	full-time	enrollment	standards previously	discussed	would	still	apply	for	the	standard	terms.	However,	if	a	program	has	nonstandard	terms,	the	full-time enrollment	standard	must	be	calculated	for	the	nonstandard	terms.	Full-time	enrollment	status	for	a	nonstandard	term	is determined	based	on	the	length	of	the	term	in	relation	to	the	academic	year:

[Weeks	in	nonstandard	term	÷	weeks	in	academic	year	(at	least	30)]	x	Credit-hours	in	academic	year

After	you	determine	the	number	of	credit	hours	required	for	full-time	enrollment,	you	can	then	determine	the	enrollment intensity	for	the	nonstandard	term	using	the	following	formula:

Credit	hours	student	takes	in	the	nonstandard	term	÷	Credit	hours	required	for	full-time	enrollment	in	the	nonstandard term

Notes: These	fractions	use	weeks	of	instructional	time	as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	which	are	not necessarily	the	same	number	as	the	calendar	weeks	in	an	academic	year.

If	the	program9s	coursework	is	offered	in	whole	credits,	the	resulting	number	is	rounded	up	to	the	next	whole number	(e.g.,	3.3	is	rounded	up	to	4).

If	the	program9s	coursework	is	offered	in	fractions,	the	minimum	number	of	credits	required	for	full-time enrollment	need	not	be	rounded.	For	example,	3.3	would	remain	3.3	as	full	time,	and	a	student	taking	3.4	credits in	the	term	would	be	full	time.

Determining	Full-Time	Enrollment	for	Nonstandard	Terms

## 34	CFR	668.2(b)	&lt;Full-time	student=

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	8:	Payments	for	Nonstandard	Terms	of	Equal	Length

A	school	has	a	program	that	consists	of	four	8-week	terms.	The	school	defines	its	academic	year	as	40	quarter hours	and	32	weeks	of	instructional	time.	Because	this	program	does	not	use	standard	terms	(semesters, trimesters,	or	quarters),	the	school	must	use	Formula	3	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	disbursements	for	students	in	the program.

- Scheduled	Award:	$7,500
- Full-time	calculation:	(8	weeks	in	term	x	40	quarter	hours)	÷	32	weeks	in	academic	year
- Full	time:	10	quarter	hours

To	determine	the	student9s	payment	for	each	payment	period,	multiply	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the	length	of	the nonstandard	term	compared	to	the	length	of	the	academic	year.

- Payment	calculation:	(8	weeks	in	term	x	$7,500)	÷	32	weeks	in	academic	year	=	$1,875

## Disbursement	Schedule

|                                       | Term 1 (8 weeks)   | Term 2 (8 weeks)   | Term 3 (8 weeks)   | Term 4 (8 weeks)   |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Credit Hours (Enrollment Intensity %) | 10 (100%)          | 12 (100%)          | 10 (100%)          | 10 (100%)          |
| Disbursement                          | $1,875             | $1,875             | $1,875             | $1,875             |

Because	the	student	in	this	example	will	be	enrolled	on	a	full-time	basis	(at	least	10	hours	each	term),	the student9s	annual	award	is	the	same	as	the	Scheduled	Award.	A	student	enrolled	less	than	full-time	must	have their	Scheduled	Award	prorated	based	on	enrollment	intensity	in	each	term.	For	example,	a	student	enrolled	in	8 credits	in	Term	1	would	have	enrollment	intensity	of	80%.	Their	disbursement	for	Term	1	would	be	[($7,500	X 80%)	x	8]	÷	32	=	$1,500.	This	is	a	term-based,	credit-hour	program,	so	the	payment	period	is	the	term.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	9:	Payments	for	Nonstandard	Terms	of	Unequal	Length

A	school	has	a	10-week	nonstandard	term	between	two	12-week	nonstandard	terms.	The	terms	do	not	overlap. The	academic	year	for	the	program	is	defined	as	34	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	24	semester	hours.	Courses are	offered	in	whole	credits.	The	school	must	use	Formula	3	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	payments	for	students	in	this program.

A	student	enrolls	in	six	credit	hours	in	each	of	the	three	terms.	Because	the	program	has	nonstandard	terms,	the school	must	determine	the	number	of	credit-hours	required	for	full-time	enrollment	in	each	term,	as	follows.

## For	the	first	and	third	terms:

- (12	weeks	in	term	x	24	semester	hours)	÷	34	weeks	in	academic	year	=	8.47	(round	up	to	9)

For	the	second	term:

- (10	weeks	in	term	x	24	semester	hours)	÷	34	weeks	in	academic	year	=	7.06	(round	up	to	8)

To	be	full	time	a	student	must	enroll	in	nine	semester	hours	(rounded	up	from	8.47)	in	the	first	and	third	terms, and	eight	semester	hours	(rounded	up	from	7.06)	in	the	second	term.

Below	is	a	sample	disbursement	schedule	for	a	student	who	enrolls	in	6	credits	in	each	of	the	three	terms.

- Scheduled	award:	$7,005
- Enrollment	intensity:	Terms	1	and	3	=	6	÷	9	or	67%;	Term	2	=	6	÷	8	or	75%

Pell	Formula	4:	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Programs

All	clock-hour	and	non-term	credit-hour	programs	must	use	Formula	4.

Pell	Formula	4

34	CFR	690.63(a)(4)

34	CFR	690.63(e)

Enrollment	Intensity	in	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Programs

For	clock-hour	programs	and	for	non-term	credit-hour	programs,	enrollment	intensity	only	makes	a	difference	if	the student	is	attending	less	than	half	time.	If	that9s	the	case,	only	certain	components	of	the	COA	are	used	(see	the discussion	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook).

The	annual	award	for	a	student	in	a	clock-hour	or	non-term	credit-hour	program	is	always	based	on	the	fulltime	Scheduled	Award,	even	if	the	student	is	attending	less	than	full	time.

Calculating	Payment	Amounts	in	Clock-Hour	and	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Programs

Pell	Grants	must	be	paid	in	installments	over	the	course	of	the	academic	year	or	program	of	study	to	help	meet	the student9s	costs	in	each	payment	period.	The	payment	period	determines	when	Pell	funds	are	disbursed	and	the	exact amount	to	be	disbursed.	You	must	use	the	rules	discussed	in	Chapter	1	of	Volume	3	to	determine	the	payment	periods	for clock-hour	and	non-term	credit-hour	programs.

In	non-term	programs,	the	student9s	Pell	award	is	not	reduced	for	part-time	enrollment	unless	the	student	is	enrolled	less than	half	time,	in	which	case	the	student9s	COA	must	be	adjusted.	However,	if	a	program	is	less	than	an	academic	year	in length	(in	either	clock/credit	hours	or	weeks	of	instructional	time),	students	enrolled	in	the	program	won9t	receive	a	full Scheduled	Award.

As	in	the	case	of	the	other	formulas,	you	must	perform	comparable	prorations	of	the	award	for	each	payment	period	in the	student9s	program.	The	calculation	for	the	payment	period	prorates	a	student9s	Scheduled	Award	based	on	either	(1) the	number	of	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	payment	period	compared	to	the	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	defined	academic year	or	(2)	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	payment	period	compared	to	the	weeks	of	instructional	time in	the	academic	year.	To	determine	the	payment	for	a	payment	period,	multiply	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	by	the lesser	of:

Number	of	credit/clock	hours	in	the	payment	period	÷	Number	of	credit/clock	hours	in	the	program9s	academic	year

OR

Weeks	in	the	payment	period	÷	Weeks	in	the	program9s	academic	year

Note: These	fractions	use	weeks	of	instructional	time	as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	which	are	not necessarily	the	same	number	as	the	calendar	weeks	in	an	academic	year.	The	program9s	defined	academic	year must	be	at	least	30	weeks	for	credit-hour	programs	or	26	weeks	for	clock-hour	programs.

Enrollment	Intensity	Standards	for	Clock-Hour	and	Other	Non-Term	Programs

For	non-term	programs,	the	enrollment	minimums	are:

- Full-time	enrollment	(clock	hours):	at	least	24	clock	hours	per	calendar	week.
- Full-time	enrollment	(credit	hours):	24	semester	hours,	24	trimester	hours,	or	36	quarter	hours	per	academic	year.
- Less	than	half-time	enrollment	(clock	hours	and	credit	hours)	is	defined	as	less	than	half	of	the	workload	of	the minimum	full-time	requirement.

Pell	Formula	4	Examples

Note: Examples	use	fictional	maximum	($7,500)	and	minimum	($750)	Pell	Grant	award	amounts	for demonstration	purposes	only.	Award	amounts	in	examples	in	this	volume	should	not	be	used	in	packaging	Pell Grants	for	the	2025-26	award	year.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	10:	Payments	for	Clock-Hour	Program

A	school	offers	a	program	that	is	900	clock-hours	and	22	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	length.	The	school	defines the	academic	year	for	the	program	based	on	the	regulatory	minimums:	900	clock-hours	and	26	weeks	of instructional	time.	The	school	has	established	two	payment	periods	of	450	clock	hours	and	11	weeks	each	for	this program.

To	determine	the	disbursement	for	the	payment	period,	the	school	must	multiply	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the lesser	of:

- the	fraction	comparing	the	hours	in	the	payment	period	to	the	hours	in	the	academic	year	(450/900),	or
- the	fraction	comparing	the	weeks	in	the	payment	period	to	the	weeks	in	the	academic	year	(11/26).

If	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500,	the	two	possible	calculations	would	be	as	follows:

- (450	clock	hours	in	the	payment	period	*	$7,500)	÷	900	clock	hours	in	the	academic	year	=	$3,750;	or
- (11	weeks	in	the	payment	period	*	$7,500)	÷	26	weeks	in	the	program9s	academic	year	=	$3,173.08

In	this	example,	the	lesser	fraction	is	the	one	based	on	weeks.	Therefore,	the	student9s	payment	for	the	first payment	period	will	be	$3,173.08	(or	$3,173	if	your	school	does	not	award	cents).	The	student	can	get	this payment	when	they	begin	the	program.	They	can	receive	a	second	payment	of	$3,173.08	(or	$3,173	if	your school	does	not	award	cents)	after	the	student	successfully	completes	the	450	clock	hours	and	11	weeks	in	the first	payment	period.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	4,	Example	11:	Payments	for	Credit-Hour	Non-term	Program

A	school	offers	a	program	that	is	24	quarter	hours	and	20	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	length.	The	academic year	for	the	program	is	defined	as	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	school	has	established two	payment	periods	of	12	quarter	hours	and	10	weeks	each	for	this	program.	To	determine	the	disbursement	for the	payment	period,	the	school	must	multiply	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the	lesser	of:

- the	fraction	comparing	the	hours	in	the	payment	period	to	the	hours	in	the	academic	year	(12/36),	or
- the	fraction	comparing	the	weeks	in	the	payment	period	to	the	weeks	in	the	academic	year	(10/30).

If	a	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500,	the	two	possible	calculations	would	be	as	follows:

- (12	quarter	hours	x	$7,500)	÷	36	quarter	hours	in	academic	year	=	$2,500;	or
- (10	weeks	*	$7,500)	÷	30	weeks	in	program's	academic	year	=	$2,500

Since	the	two	resulting	fractions	(12/36	and	10/30)	are	the	same,	either	calculation	produces	the	same	result: $2,500.	Thus,	the	student9s	payment	for	the	first	payment	period	will	be	$2,500.	The	student	can	receive	this payment	when	they	begin	the	program.	The	school	can	make	a	second	payment	of	$2,500	after	the	school	has determined	that	the	student	has	successfully	completed	12	quarter	hours	and	10	weeks	of	instructional	time	of the	program.

Coursework	Completion	Requirement	and	Withdrawal/Re-entry	in	Non-term	Programs

Students	in	non-term	programs	must	successfully	complete	a	payment	period	to	receive	subsequent	payments.	We discuss	the	effect	of	withdrawal	and	re-entry	into	a	program	in	Volume	5.

Pell	Formula	5:	Calculations	for	Correspondence	Study	Programs

Formulas	5A	and	5B	must	be	used	for	correspondence	study	programs.	Students	enrolled	in	correspondence	courses	are eligible	for	aid	under	Title	IV	programs	only	if	the	courses	are	part	of	a	program	leading	to	an	associate9s,	bachelor9s,	or graduate	degree.	In	addition,	the	correspondence	program	must	meet	the	criteria	for	an	eligible	program	(see	Volume	2 of	the	FSA	Handbook).

## Pell	Grants	for	Correspondence	Study

## 34	CFR	690.66

The	cost	of	attendance	(COA)	for	students	engaged	in	a	program	of	study	by	correspondence	must	include	tuition	and fees	and,	if	required,	books,	course	materials,	supplies,	and	equipment.	A	school	may	also	include	an	allowance	for	travel, housing,	and	food	costs	incurred	specifically	for	a	period	of	residential	training.	The	COA	must	be	based	on	the	costs	for	a full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year	for	the	relevant	component.	If	the	student9s	program	or	period	of	enrollment,	as measured	in	credit	hours,	is	longer	or	shorter	than	an	academic	year	as	measured	in	credit	hours,	the	tuition	and	fees	for the	program	or	enrollment	period	must	be	prorated.

Because	the	correspondence	study	COA	for	the	nonresidential	component	only	includes	costs	associated	with	credit hours,	your	school	always	uses	the	credit-hour-related	fraction	to	prorate	the	COA.	(Because	there	are	no	costs	associated with	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	correspondence	cost	of	attendance,	your	school	must	prorate	the	cost	only	if	the number	of	hours	in	the	program	is	shorter	or	longer	than	in	an	academic	year):

Credit	hours	in	program9s	definition	of	an	academic	year	÷	Credit	hours	to	which	the	costs	apply

The	resulting	amount	is	the	full-time,	full-academic-year	cost	used	for	calculating	Pell	Grant	eligibility.

## Pell	Enrollment	Intensity	for	Correspondence	Study	Programs

Students	enrolled	in	programs	of	correspondence	study	are	no	more	than	half-time	students	(the	equivalent	of	50% enrollment	intensity),	even	if	they	are	enrolled	in	enough	coursework	to	be	full	time.	However,	if	the	correspondence study	is	combined	with	regular	coursework,	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	might	be	more	than	50%.	For	a	student enrolled	in	a	term-based	correspondence	program,	your	school	must	determine	how	many	credits	to	include	in	the numerator	of	the	enrollment	intensity	formula	to	determine	the	student9s	annual	award.	See	the	&lt;Students	taking	a combination	of	regular	and	correspondence	courses=	section	in	Chapter	3	for	additional	guidance.

A	student	enrolled	only	in	a	non-term	correspondence	program	always	has	their	award	calculated	based	on	50% enrollment	intensity.

Pell	Correspondence	Payment	Periods	and	Timing	of	Payments

For	a	non-term	correspondence	program,	there	must	be	two	equal	payment	periods	in	each	academic	year.	Each	payment period	is	the	lesser	of	half	the	academic	year	or	half	the	program	(measured	in	credit	hours).	In	addition,	you	can9t disburse	a	Pell	payment	for	the	first	payment	period	until	the	student	has	completed	25%	of	the	work	in	the	academic year	or	the	program,	whichever	is	shorter.	You	can9t	make	the	second	payment	until	the	student	has	completed	75%	of the	work	in	the	academic	year	or	program.

For	a	term-based	correspondence	program,	as	for	other	term-based	programs,	the	payment	period	is	the	term.	However, you	can9t	disburse	Pell	for	a	payment	period	until	the	student	has	completed	50%	of	the	lessons	or	completes	50%	of	the work	for	the	term,	whichever	is	later.

Pell	Grant	Correspondence	Program	Disbursements

## 34	CFR	690.66

If	the	correspondence	program	has	a	required	period	of	residential	training,	you	must	treat	the	residential	training	as	an additional	payment	period	and	determine	the	payment	for	that	payment	period	using	either	Formula	3	or	Formula	4.	Note that	the	correspondence	portion	of	the	program	is	still	treated	as	a	separate	portion	of	the	program	that9s	divided	into equal	payment	periods.

Pell	Calculations	in	Correspondence	Programs

Formula	5	is	used	for	students	enrolled	only	in	correspondence	courses	(not	including	residential	components	of correspondence	programs).	There	are	two	versions	of	Formula	5:

- 1.	 Formula	5A	(which	is	like	Formula	4)	is	used	for non-term programs,	and
- 2.	 Formula	5B	(which	is	like	Formula	3)	is	used	for term-based programs.

For	a	residential	component	of	a	correspondence	program,	you	must	use	either	Formula	3	or	Formula	4.	If	the	residential component	is	a	term,	you	must	Formula	3;	otherwise,	you	use	Formula	4.

For	non-term	correspondence	programs,	this	step	of	the	calculation	is	like	the	step	under	Formula	4.	For	term-based correspondence	programs,	this	step	is	the	same	as	under	Formula	3.

For	the	Pell	calculation,	you	are	required	to	determine	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program	by preparing	a	written	schedule	for	the	lessons	that	the	student	will	submit.	A	non-term	correspondence	program	must require	at	least	12	hours	of	preparation	per	week.	A	term-based	correspondence	program	must	require	at	least	30	hours of	preparation	per	semester	hour	or	at	least	20	hours	of	preparation	per	quarter	hour	during	the	term.

Correspondence	Payment	Periods

34	CFR	690.66(b)	4	non-term

34	CFR	690.66(c)(3)	and	(c)(4)	4	term-based

Formula	5A:	Non-Term	Correspondence	Program

You	first	multiply	the	annual	award	(50%	of	the	Scheduled	Award)	by	the	lesser	of:

Number	of	credit-hours	in	the	payment	period	÷	Credit-hours	in	the	program9s	academic	year	definition

OR

Weeks	in	the	payment	period	÷	Weeks	in	the	program9s	academic	year	definition

## Notes:

Note: These	fractions	use	weeks	of	instructional	time	as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	which	are	not necessarily	the	same	number	as	the	calendar	weeks	in	an	academic	year.

Formula	5B:	Term	Correspondence	Program

You	multiply	the	annual	award	(Scheduled	Award	times	enrollment	intensity)	by	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the term	divided	by	the	weeks	in	the	academic	year:

Weeks	in	the	term	÷	Weeks	in	the	program9s	academic	year	definition

These	fractions	use	weeks	of	instructional	time	as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	which	are	not	necessarily	the	same number	as	the	calendar	weeks	in	an	academic	year.

A	single	disbursement	for	a	payment	period	can	never	be	more	than	50%	of	the	annual	award.	If	the	resulting	amount	is more	than	50%	of	the	annual	award,	your	school	must	make	the	payment	in	at	least	two	disbursements	in	that	payment period.	You	may	not	disburse	an	amount	that	exceeds	50%	of	the	annual	award	until	the	student	has	completed	the	time in	the	payment	period	that	equals	50%	of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s	academic	year	definition.

Correspondence	Multiple	Formulas	Exception

If	a	correspondence	student	has	one	or	more	payment	periods	in	an	award	year	that	contain	only	correspondence	study, and	one	or	more	payment	periods	in	the	same	award	year	that	contain	a	residential	portion,	your	school	will	use	two different	formulas	for	determining	a	student9s	payment	for	each	payment	period.	This	is	the	only	circumstance	in	which	a school	would	use	two	different	Pell	formulas	within	the	same	award	year	for	students	in	the	same	program.

## Academic	Coursework

The	phrase	&lt;academic	coursework=	does	not	necessarily	refer	to	credits.	If	a	student	does	not	earn	any	credits	until	the end	of	the	term	or	program,	&lt;academic	coursework=	may	refer	to	the	lessons	or	other	measures	of	learning	within	a course	or	a	program.	For	instance,	if	a	course	or	program	is	made	up	of	40	equal	lessons,	the	student	reaches	the	halfway point	as	follows:

- If	the	student	successfully	completes	the	first	20	lessons	before	the	calendar	midpoint	of	the	academic	year,	the second	payment	period	does	not	begin	until	the	calendar	midpoint.
- If	the	student	completes	the	first	half	of	the	academic	year	before	successfully	completing	the	first	20	lessons,	the second	payment	period	does	not	begin	until	the	student	successfully	completes	the	first	20	lessons.

## Chapter	5

## Summer	Terms,	Crossover	Payment	Periods,	and	Year-Round	Pell

Payment	periods	don9t	always	fall	neatly	into	one	award	year	or	another.	A	payment	period	that	begins	before	July	1	and ends	on	or	after	July	1	is	called	a	&lt;crossover	payment	period.=	The	formula	for	calculating	the	payment	for	a	crossover payment	period	is	the	same	as	that	for	any	other	payment	period	in	the	award	year.

## Crossover	Payment	Periods

## 34	CFR	690.64

Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-17-06

## Crossover	Payment	From	the	Proper	Award	Year

For	Pell	purposes,	you	must	consider	a	crossover	payment	period	to	occur	entirely	within	one	award	year	and	calculate the	student9s	Pell	award	and	disburse	Pell	funds	from	the	award	year	selected.	If	you	only	have	a	valid	FAFSA	Submission Summary/ISIR	from	one	award	year,	you	must	rely	on	that	record	and	the	award	year	to	which	the	valid	FAFSA Submission	Summary/ISIR	pertains.	Aside	from	these	considerations,	the	decision	about	which	award	year	to	use	is	based on	the	student9s	remaining	eligibility	in	the	earlier	award	year.	This	assessment	is	made	according	to	your	school9s payment	period	policy,	which	for	crossover	Pell	payment	periods	may	apply	to:

- an	individual	student;
- all	students	or	a	category	of	students	without	exception;	or
- all	students	or	a	category	of	students	with	allowance	for	exceptions	in	the	case	of	individual	students.

Although	you	may	assign	a	crossover	payment	period	to	either	of	the	relevant	award	years	(subject	to	the	limitations described	below),	you	must	make	the	assignment	based	on	what	you	determine	will	be	most	beneficial	to	students.

You	may	assign	the	Pell	Grant	award	to	a	different	award	year	than	the	rest	of	the	student9s	Title	IV	aid.	You	can	make	a payment	for	a	crossover	payment	period	out	of	either	award	year	if	the	student	has	a	valid	FAFSA	Submission Summary/ISIR	for	the	award	year	selected.	You	may	assign	two	consecutive	crossover	payment	periods	to	the	same award	year.	For	example,	you	could	treat	summer	2025	and	summer	2026	as	both	being	in	the	2025-26	award	year.	You may	also	source	the	Pell	funds	from	different	award	years	for	different	students,	as	their	eligibility	allows,	depending	on their	remaining	eligibility	and	financial	need.

You	may	not	make	a	payment	which	will	result	in	the	student	receiving	more	than	their	Scheduled	Award	for	an	award year,	unless	the	student	is	eligible	for	a	Year-Round	Pell	award	(see	Year-Round	Pell	Grant	section	later	in	this	chapter),	in which	case	the	student	may	be	eligible	to	receive	up	to	150%	of	their	Scheduled	Award	for	the	award	year.

Term	Schools:	Using	the	Formula	for	Summer	Sessions

If	your	school	offers	a	summer	term	in	addition	to	fall	through	spring	terms	that	qualify	for	Formula	1	or	2,	you	will calculate	the	student9s	payment	for	the	summer	term	using	the	same	formula	that	you	used	to	calculate	payments	for	the other	terms	in	the	award	year	to	which	the	summer	term	is	assigned.	If	you	use	Formula	3	for	Pell	Grant	calculations	in any	of	the	terms	in	an	award	year,	then	you	must	use	Formula	3	for	all	terms	in	that	program	occurring	in	that	award year,	including	the	fall	through	spring	terms.	(Note	that	if	your	program	is	a	standard-term	program	in	the	fall	through spring	and	does	not	define	full-time	enrollment	in	the	summer	as	at	least	12	credit-hours,	you	must	use	Formula	3	for	Pell calculations	for	all	terms	in	the	award	year.) Your	school	must	apply	its	definition	of	full-time	status	for	the summer	term	consistently	for	all	Title	IV	program	purposes.

## Pell	Grant	COA	for	Summer	Terms

Costs	used	to	determine	Pell	Grant	eligibility	for	summer	terms	are	figured	in	the	same	way	as	for	any	other	payment period;	that	is,	the	costs	are	based	on	the	costs	for	a	full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year.	If	your	school	has	fall	and spring	semesters	that	comprise	an	academic	year,	you	can9t	add	the	costs	for	the	summer	term	to	the	costs	for	the	fall and	spring	semesters.	The	award	for	the	summer	term	is	still	based	on	the	costs	for	one	academic	year.	However,	if	the academic	year	definition	includes	the	summer	term,	then	the	costs	for	the	summer	term	must	be	included	in	the	cost	for a	full	academic	year.

If	the	student	was	previously	enrolled	in	the	award	year,	you	may	be	able	to	use	the	same	Pell	Grant	COA	for	the	summer term	that	you	used	for	the	immediately	preceding	term	that	the	student	attended.	However,	this	isn9t	possible	if	the	costs are	different	from	the	fall	through	spring,	such	as	a	different	tuition	charge	per	credit	hour,	or	if	you	are	required	to recalculate	the	Pell	Grant	COA.	If	it9s	necessary	to	base	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	COA	on	the	summer	term,	you	must prorate	the	summer	costs	to	the	length	of	an	academic	year	to	establish	the	cost	for	a	full	academic	year.	See	Chapter	3 of	this	volume	for	additional	information	on	prorating	costs	in	the	Pell	Grant	program.

If	the	summer	session	is	the	first	term	in	the	award	year	for	that	student	(for	example,	your	school	is	paying	a	student	for the	summer	2025	term	from	the	2025-26	award	year),	you	must	establish	the	student9s	full-year	cost	based	on	the	costs for	the	summer	term.	If	the	student	enrolls	in	another	term	in	that	award	year,	you	may	have	to	recalculate	the	student9s costs	for	the	later	term.

## Receiving	Less	Than	the	Scheduled	Award	Due	to	Crossover

A	student	may	also	receive	less	than	a	Scheduled	Award	in	an	award	year	if	the	student9s	program	crosses	award	years and	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	award	in	one	of	the	award	years	is	for	a	portion	of	the	program	that	is	less	than	a	full academic	year.	For	example,	if	a	student9s	last	term	of	enrollment	to	complete	their	academic	program	is	summer	2025, and	the	school	treats	the	payment	period	as	a	header	to	the	2025-26	academic	year,	the	student	may	receive	a	Pell	Grant disbursement	for	that	one	payment	period,	which	will	be	less	than	the	student9s	full	Scheduled	Award	for	2025-26.

## Crossover	Pell	and	Withdrawal

For	details	on	how	to	perform	Return	of	Title	IV	Funds	calculations	in	a	crossover	Pell	situation,	see	Volume	5,	Chapter	2	of the	FSA	Handbook.

## Summer	Modules

If	a	term-based	school	offers	a	series	of	modules	that	overlap	two	award	years,	these	modules	may	be	combined	and treated	as	one	term.	Schools	are	not	required	to	combine	modules.	However,	if	you	do	not	combine	the	modules	to	create a	single	term	and	the	modules	overlap,	the	program	must	be	considered	a	non-term	program.

When	you	combine	modules	into	a	single	term	(i.e.,	payment	period),	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	combined term	are	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	from	the	beginning	of	the	first	module	to	the	date	the	last	module	ends.	The student9s	enrollment	intensity	for	the	entire	payment	period	must	be	calculated	based	on	the	total	number	of	credits	the student	is	projected	to	take	for	all	modules.	You	must	project	the	enrollment	intensity	for	a	student	based	on	the	credits the	student	has:

- Pre-registered	or	registered	to	take	for	all	modules;
- Committed	to	take	for	all	modules	in	an	academic	plan	or	enrollment	contract;	or
- Committed	to	take	for	all	modules	in	some	other	document.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	1:	Module	Enrollment	Intensity

A	student	is	enrolled	in	a	summer	session	with	three-week	modules	that	School	A	has	combined	into	one	term. The	school	uses	Formula	1	to	calculate	the	student9s	payment	for	the	combined	term	and	must	define	full-time enrollment	as	at	least	12	credit	hours,	even	though	full-time	enrollment	for	an	individual	module	may	be	defined as	fewer	than	12	credit	hours.	The	student	is	enrolled	for	six	credits	during	the	combined	summer	term.	The student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	equal	to	the	proportion	of	the	number	of	credits	for	which	the	student	is	enrolled to	the	number	of	credit	hours	in	the	school9s	definition	of	full-time	enrollment	for	the	combined	term.	Therefore, the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	50%	for	the	combined	summer	term.

When	you	combine	the	modules	into	a	single	term,	a	student	cannot	be	paid	more	than	the	amount	for	one	payment period	for	completing	any	combination	of	the	modules.	If	the	modules	are	not	combined	into	a	single	payment	period	and they	do	not	overlap	each	other,	you	must	treat	each	module	as	a	separate	nonstandard	term	and	generally	must	use Formula	3	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	payments	for	the	program.	If,	for	each	module,	you	define	full	time	as	at	least	12	credit hours,	you	may	be	able	to	use	Formula	1	or	2	if	the	program	otherwise	qualifies	for	one	of	these	formulas.

If	a	combined	module	term	crosses	over	the	June	30	award	year	end	date	to	include	the	July	1	award	year	begin	date,	the combined	term	must	be	treated	as	a	crossover	payment	period	regardless	of	which	modules	students	attend.	If	your program	has	two	summer	modules	and	only	one	of	the	modules	crosses	over	the	award	year	date	boundary	and	you	do not	combine	the	sessions	into	a	larger	term,	then	only	the	term	that	spans	the	award	year	boundary	is	considered	a crossover	payment	period.

If	the	modules	are	combined	in	a	single	term	and	a	student	does	not	begin	attendance	in	all	the	modules	that	they	were expected	to	attend,	recalculation	of	prior	disbursements	is	required	based	on	the	resulting	changed	enrollment	status. Also,	if	you	use	Formula	3	for	any	of	the	summer	modules,	or	any	other	nonstandard	term	(e.g.,	a	winter	intersession	that is	not	attached	to	an	adjacent	standard	term),	remember	that	you	must	also	use	it	for	all	other	terms	in	the	award	year, including	fall	through	spring.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	2:	Modules	Combined	Into	One	Term

A	student	enrolls	part	time	at	a	school	which	defines	its	academic	year	as	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of instructional	time.	In	addition	to	fall	and	spring	semesters,	the	school	offers	three	summer	modules.	Each	module provides	four	weeks	of	instructional	time	(as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1).	The	school	can	either	combine	the modules	into	a	single	standard	term	or	treat	each	module	as	a	separate	nonstandard	term.	The	school	chooses	to combine	the	modules	into	a	single	term	providing	12	weeks	of	instructional	time	with	full-time	enrollment	defined as	12	semester	hours.	If	the	school	meets	the	conditions	for	use	of	Formula	1	in	its	fall	and	spring	semesters,	it can	use	Formula	1	to	calculate	Pell	Grant	payments	for	this	summer	session.

The	student	enrolls	for	three	semester	hours	in	each	of	the	modules	(nine	hours	total	in	the	combined	term)	which is	75%	enrollment	intensity.	The	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500	and	their	annual	award	is	$5,625	($7,500	x 75%).	To	calculate	the	student9s	payment,	the	school	simply	divides	the	annual	award	by	two,	the	number	of terms	in	the	fall	through	spring:	$5,625/2	=	$2,812.50.	The	school	may	round	the	payment	up	to	$2,813.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	3:	Modules	Treated	as	Nonstandard	Terms

If	the	school	didn9t	combine	these	modules	and	defined	full-time	enrollment	for	each	4-week	module	as	fewer than	12	semester	hours,	it	would	have	to	calculate	all	Pell	payments	for	the	program	using	Formula	3.	Because these	are	nonstandard	terms,	the	school	would	have	to	determine	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	for	each module	by	prorating	the	standard	for	full-time	enrollment	in	a	full	academic	year	(24	semester	hours):

(24	semester	hours	×	4	weeks	in	module)	÷	30	weeks	in	academic	year	=	3.2	semester	hours	(round	up	to	4 semester	hours	because	the	school	only	offers	courses	in	whole	credits)

Note: Weeks	of	instructional	time	are	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	which	are	not	necessarily	the	same	number as	the	calendar	weeks	in	an	academic	year.

For	each	of	the	4-week	modules,	a	full-time	student	must	enroll	in	4	semester	hours,	and	based	on	that	standard, the	3	semester	hours	that	the	student	is	attending	in	each	module	count	as	75%	enrollment	intensity	(3	÷	4).	The student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500	and	their	annual	award	is	$5,625	($7,500	x	75%).	Note	that	the	school	would use	the	Pell	COA	for	a	full-time	student	attending	a	full	academic	year.

The	school	would	determine	the	student9s	payment	for	each	module	(assuming	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award remains	unchanged	across	both	award	years):

(4	weeks	in	module	×	$5,625)	÷	30	weeks	in	academic	year	=	$750

The	student	would	receive	$750	for	each	of	the	modules,	for	a	total	of	$2,250	for	the	summer.	Again,	these payments	for	one	or	more	modules	that	are	in	the	prior	award	year	may	need	to	be	reduced	if	the	student	had previously	received	payments	for	the	fall	and	spring	semesters	in	the	same	award	year.	Also,	the	school	must	use Formula	3	for	the	fall	through	spring	terms.

## Year-Round	Pell	Grant

Students	may	be	eligible	to	receive	up	to	150%	of	their	Pell	Grant	Scheduled	Award	for	an	award	year.	This	provision	is called	"Year-Round	Pell"	or	"additional	Pell=.	Students	eligible	for	Year-Round	Pell	awards	are	subject	to	the	normal duration	of	eligibility	rules	and	LEU	limits.

Year-Round	Pell	allows	students	who	have	already	exhausted	their	Scheduled	Award	for	an	award	year	to	continue receiving	Pell	funds	(for	example,	for	a	summer	trailer	term),	or	to	receive	Pell	funds	without	prematurely	reducing	their Pell	eligibility	for	the	remainder	of	the	award	year	(for	example,	for	a	summer	header	term).	A	student9s	Year-Round	Pell eligibility	is	certified	by	the	Additional	Eligibility	Indicator	(AEI)	in	COD.

With	Year-Round	Pell,	students	do	not	receive	more	Pell	Grant	funds	in	each	payment	period.	They	receive	the	same amount	as	is	normally	calculated	for	a	payment	period,	but	students	who	are	otherwise	eligible	for	Pell	Grants	may receive	Pell	Grant	funds	for	an	award	year	up	to	150%	of	their	Scheduled	Award.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	4:	Year-Round	Pell	at	a	Semester	School	with	Full-Time	Enrollment

A	student	attends	a	school	which	provides	coursework	on	a	semester	calendar,	defines	full	time	as	12	credits,	and awards	Pell	using	Formula	1.	The	student9s	enrollment	begins	in	the	fall	semester.	The	student9s	Scheduled	Award is	$6,005.	The	student	plans	to	enroll	full-time	in	the	fall	and	spring	semesters,	so	their	annual	award	is	equal	to the	Scheduled	Award.	Since	the	school9s	academic	calendar	consists	of	two	semesters,	the	school	divides	the Scheduled	Award	by	2	to	determine	the	student9s	payment	for	the	fall	and	spring	terms	($6,005	÷	2	=	$3,002.50 which	the	school	rounds	to	$3,003	in	the	fall	and	down	to	$3,002	in	the	spring).	The	student	has	now	received 100%	of	their	Scheduled	Award	for	the	year.

The	student	decides	to	enroll	for	the	summer	term,	which	the	school	treats	as	a	trailer	to	the	previous	award	year. Without	Year-Round	Pell,	the	student9s	Pell	eligibility	would	be	exhausted,	but	the	Year-Round	Pell	provision	allows the	student	to	receive	their	calculated	award	of	up	to	$3,002.50	in	additional	Pell	funds	for	the	summer	term, based	on	their	enrollment	intensity,	not	to	exceed	150%	of	their	Scheduled	Award.	If	the	student	enrolls	full-time and	the	school	chooses	to	award	in	whole	dollars,	the	school	should	truncate	(not	round)	the	cents	and	award $3,002	for	the	summer	term	so	as	not	to	exceed	150%	of	the	Scheduled	Award.

Further,	a	student	may	receive	funds	from	the	first	100%	of	their	Scheduled	Award	and	some	portion	of	the	additional 50%	of	their	Scheduled	Award	from	the	Year-Round	provisions	in	the	same	payment	period.

Year-Round	Pell

## Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-17-06

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	5:	Year-Round	Pell	at	a	Semester	School	with	Part-Time	Enrollment

A	student	attends	a	school	which	provides	coursework	on	a	semester	calendar,	defines	full	time	as	12	credits,	and awards	Pell	using	Formula	1.	The	student9s	enrollment	begins	in	the	summer,	which	the	school	treats	as	a	header to	the	2025-26	award	year.	The	student	has	a	Scheduled	Award	of	$7,000.	The	student	enrolls	in	9	credits	in	the summer	term.	The	student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	75%	(9	credits	enrolled	÷	12	credits	required	for	full-time).	To determine	the	annual	award,	the	school	multiplies	the	Scheduled	Award	by	the	enrollment	intensity	($7,000	x 75%	=	$5,250).	Since	the	school9s	academic	calendar	consists	of	two	semesters,	the	school	divides	the	annual award	by	2	to	determine	the	student9s	payment	for	the	summer	term	($5,250	÷	2	=	$2,625).	This	represents 37.5%	of	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award.

After	the	summer	term,	the	student	continues	in	the	fall	and	enrolls	full	time.	The	student9s	fall	Pell	award	is $3,500	(the	school	disburses	50%	of	a	Scheduled	Award	for	the	fall	semester).	The	student	has	now	received 87.5%	($6,125)	of	their	$7,000	Scheduled	Award,	leaving	12.5%	($875)	in	remaining	eligibility.

The	student	again	enrolls	full	time	in	the	spring	term.	Under	Pell	rules,	the	student	has	only	12.5%	($875)	in remaining	eligibility	from	their	Scheduled	Award.	However,	since	the	student	meets	all	the	other	standard	Pell eligibility	criteria,	the	student	is	eligible	for	a	Year-Round	Pell	award	amount	of	up	to	50%	of	their	Scheduled Award.	This	means	that	the	student	could	receive	a	total	of	up	to	$10,500	(150%	of	their	Scheduled	Award amount	of	$7,000)	for	the	award	year.	However,	the	disbursement	for	each	term	must	be	calculated	per	the	Pell rules	described	in	this	volume,	so	the	actual	amount	the	student	receives	may	be	less	than	this	maximum.

The	school	normally	awards	a	full-time	student	50%	of	their	annual	award	for	a	standard	spring	semester,	and	the award	amount	for	the	term	under	Year-Round	Pell	is	calculated	by	the	same	method	as	for	a	student9s	Scheduled Award,	so	the	student's	spring	semester	award	would	be	$3,500.	Adding	this	amount	to	the	$6,125	the	student has	already	received	for	the	award	year	totals	$9,625,	which	is	less	than	150%	of	the	student's	Scheduled	Award (specifically,	this	is	137.5%	of	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award).	Therefore,	the	school	can	award	the	spring	Pell award	of	$3,500	as	calculated.

In	this	example,	the	spring	term	disbursement	is	made	up	of	12.5%	($875)	remaining	from	the	student9s Scheduled	Award	and	37.5%	($2,625)	from	the	Year-Round	Pell	eligibility.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	5,	Example	6:	Year-Round	Pell	in	a	Clock-hour	Program

A	student	enrolls	in	an	1,125	clock-hour	program	over	32.5	weeks.	The	program	is	scheduled	to	occur	entirely within	the	2025-26	award	year	and	has	an	academic	year	of	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time. Payment	periods	1	and	2	consist	of	450	clock	hours	and	13	weeks;	payment	period	3	consists	of	225	clock	hours and	6.5	weeks.	The	student	has	a	Scheduled	Award	of	$7,000.

The	school	awards	the	student	$3,500	in	Pell	for	each	of	the	first	two	payment	periods	of	450	clock	hours	and	13 weeks	of	instructional	time.	For	the	remaining	225	hours	and	6.5	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program,	the school	calculates	that	the	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive	$1,750	in	Pell	if	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award would	allow	it.	Without	Year-Round	Pell,	the	student	would	have	no	remaining	Pell	Grant	eligibility,	as	they	have already	received	a	100%	Scheduled	Award	of	$7,000	for	2025-26,	but	with	Year-Round	Pell,	if	the	student	remains in	all	other	ways	Pell-eligible,	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	up	to	an	additional	50%	of	their	$7,000	Scheduled

Award,	for	a	maximum	total	of	$10,500.

Adding	$1,750	to	the	$7,000	the	student	has	already	received,	the	school	sees	that	the	student	will	be	awarded	a total	of	$8,750	for	2025-26,	which	is	within	their	$10,500	Year-Round	Pell	maximum.	Note	that	the	school	does not	increase	the	student9s	final	award	for	the	award	year	to	match	their	Year-Round	Pell	maximum;	the	student9s awards	for	each	payment	period	are	calculated	according	to	the	Pell	rules	described	previously	in	this	volume.

## Chapter	6

## Transfer	Students	and	Remaining	Eligibility

## Calculating	and	Awarding	Remaining	Eligibility

The	Pell	payment	for	a	transfer	student	is	calculated	in	the	same	way	as	for	any	new	student.	That	is,	you	must	calculate payments	for	each	payment	period	following	the	rules	given	in	previously	in	this	volume.	However,	a	transfer	student9s remaining	Pell	eligibility	at	your	school	is	reduced	if	the	student	received	Pell	funds	for	the	same	award	year	at	any	prior schools.	You	can	identify	the	student9s	prior	Pell	disbursements	when	you	review	their	Financial	Aid	History	in	NSLDS	and COD.

## Calculating	Remaining	Eligibility

Once	you9ve	identified	the	Pell	amounts	that	a	transfer	student	has	already	received	for	the	award	year,	you	must calculate	the	percentage	of	the	Scheduled	Award	that	has	been	used.	This	percentage	is	calculated	by	dividing	the amount	disbursed	at	the	previous	school	by	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	at	that	school	(COD	calculates	this	and	you can	refer	to	COD	to	see	what	the	percentage	of	remaining	eligibility	will	be	for	a	student).

## Pell	disbursed	at	prior	school	÷	Scheduled	Award	at	prior	school	=	%	of	Scheduled	Award	used

Then	subtract	this	percentage	from	100%	(or	150%,	if	the	student	is	enrolled	and	eligible	for	a	Year-Round	award).	The result	is	the	maximum	percentage	of	the	Scheduled	Award	that	the	student	may	receive	at	your	school.	Note	that	a transfer	student	receives	the	same	payments	as	any	other	student	until	the	limit	(up	to	150%	of	a	Scheduled	Award;	see the	Year-Round	Pell	Grant	section	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume)	is	reached. Give	the	student	the	full	amount	for	each payment	period,	rather	than	trying	to	ration	the	remaining	amount	by	splitting	it	evenly	across	the remaining	terms.

A	transfer	student	must	repay	any	amount	received	in	an	award	year	that	exceeds	their	Scheduled	Award	(or	150%	of their	Scheduled	Award,	if	enrolled	and	eligible	for	Year-Round	Pell),	unless	the	school	that	disbursed	the	award	was	at fault	by	failing	to	follow	the	administrative	requirements	in	34	CFR	668.

## Why	Percentages	Are	Used

A	student	may	have	different	Scheduled	Awards	at	different	schools/programs.	Using	percentages	ensures	that	a	student does	not	receive	more	than	100%	(or	150%,	if	enrolled	and	eligible	for	Year-Round	Pell)	of	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award. For	example,	the	COAs	at	the	two	schools	may	be	different	or	one	school	may	modify	data	elements	on	the	FAFSA	form due	to	professional	judgment	where	another	school	did	not.	The	percentages	are	also	used	to	compare	the	portions	of	a student9s	total	eligibility	that	have	been	used	at	both	schools.	If	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	the	same	at	both schools,	the	financial	aid	administrator	can	find	the	amount	of	the	student9s	remaining	eligibility	simply	by	subtracting	the amount	received	at	the	first	school	from	the	Scheduled	Award.

## Payment	Period	for	a	Transfer	Student	at	a	Non-Term	School

When	a	student	transfers	into	a	non-term	credit-hour	or	clock-hour	program	at	a	new	school,	that	student	is	starting	a new	payment	period.	For	non-term	programs,	you	must	use	the	payment	period	rules	described	in/Volume	3,	Chapter	1/to determine	the	payment	periods	for	the	remainder	of	the	student9s	program.

However,	for	a	transfer	student,	the	length	of	the	program	is	the	number	of	clock	or	credit-hours	and	the	number	of	weeks of	instructional	time	that	the	student	will	be	required	to	complete	in	the	new	program.	If	the	remaining	clock	or	credit hours/or	weeks	of	instructional	time/are	half	an	academic	year	or	less,	then	the	remaining	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional time	constitute	one	payment	period.

## Transfer	Students	and	Remaining	Eligibility

Consider	a	student	who	is	eligible	for	Pell	Grant	funds	and	who	transfers	from	School	A	to	School	B	within	the	same	award year.	Before	paying	any	Pell	funds	to	the	student,	School	B	must	determine	the	percentage	of	eligibility	remaining	for	the student.	After	transferring,	a	student9s	remaining	eligibility	for	a	Scheduled	Award	during	an	award	year	is	equal	to	the percentage	of	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	that	remains	unused,	multiplied	by	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	at	the new	school.

School	B	may	pay	the	student	a	Pell	Grant	only	for	that	portion	of	an	academic	year	in	which	the	student	is	enrolled	and	in attendance	at	School	B.	The	grant	must	be	adjusted,	as	necessary,	to	ensure	that	the	funds	received	by	the	student	for the	award	year	do	not	exceed	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	for	that	award	year	or	the	student9s	maximum	Lifetime Eligibility	Used.

The	award	for	each	payment	period	is	calculated	using	the	(full)	Scheduled	Award.	The	student	receives	a	full	award	until the	student	has	received	100%	of	the	student9s	remaining	eligibility	for	a	Scheduled	Award	(or	150%	if	the	student	is enrolled	and	otherwise	eligible	for	a	Year-Round	Pell	award)	or	600%	LEU.	This	avoids	a	school	having	to	ration	the remaining	amount	by	splitting	it	evenly	across	the	remaining	payment	periods.

To	calculate	a	transfer	student9s	remaining	eligibility	for	a	Scheduled	Award,	School	B	must	first	determine	what percentage	of	the	Scheduled	Award	the	student	used	at	School	A.	Check	COD	for	the	most	up-to-date	information	on	what aid	has	been	disbursed	to	the	student	at	all	schools.	The	remainder	is	the	unused	percentage	of	the	student9s	Scheduled Award4the	percentage	the	student	may	receive	at	School	B.	(Use	percentages	rather	than	dollars	because	a	transfer student	may	have	different	Scheduled	Awards	at	the	two	schools;	using	percentages	rather	than	dollars	adjusts	for	this possible	difference.)	School	B	then	multiplies	the	percent	of	eligibility	remaining	by	the	Scheduled	Award	at	School	B.	The result	is	the	maximum	amount	of	Federal	Pell	Grant	funds	the	student	may	receive	at	School	B	during	the	balance	of	the award	year.

## Pell	Grant	Eligibility	for	Transfer	Students

## 34	CFR	690.65

Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-01-09

## Volume	7,	Chapter	6,	Example	1:	Transfer	Student	Remaining	Eligibility

On	August	1,	2025,	a	student	enrolls	at	School	X.	After	completing	a	portion	of	the	program,	the	student withdraws	from	school.	On	February	1,	2026,	the	student	enrolls	at	School	Y	as	a	transfer	student	and	is	awarded 400	clock	hours	of	transfer	credit	toward	School	Y9s	1,000	clock-hour	program	(the	program9s	defined	academic year	is	900	clock	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time).	The	student9s	program	length	at	School	Y	is	600	clockhours	and	20	weeks	of	instructional	time.

The	FAA	at	School	Y	examines	the	student9s	2025-26	ISIR	and	finds	the	following	entry:

%Sch.	Used:	112.5

As	Of:	01/28/2026

Pell	Eligible:	Y

Based	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	results,	their	Scheduled	Award	is	$4,500.	Since	the	student	is	eligible	for	YearRound	Pell,	the	FAA	subtracts	the	112.5%	of	the	student's	Scheduled	Award	previously	used	from	150%,	which results	in	a	remaining	unused	percentage	of	37.5%.	Therefore,	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	37.5%	of	their scheduled	Pell	award	of	$4,500	during	the	balance	of	the	award	year.

The	FAA	uses	the	600	hours	and	20	weeks	of	instructional	time	remaining	in	the	student9s	program	to	establish the	appropriate	two	payment	periods	of	300	clock-hours	and	10	weeks	of	instructional	time	each	(See	Volume	3, Chapter	1	for	a	full	discussion	on	payment	periods).	The	aid	administrator	multiplies	the	student's	Scheduled Award	($4,500)	by	the	remaining	unused	percentage	(37.5%)	and	determines	that	the	student	may	receive	as much	as	$1,687.50	if	the	student	remains	enrolled	at	School	Y	for	the	balance	of	the	award	year.

During	the	first	payment	period,	the	student	receives	$1,500	in	Pell	funds:

(300	hours	in	payment	period	x	$4,500)	÷	900	hours	in	academic	year	=	$1,500

However,	in	the	second	payment	period,	the	student	can	only	receive	funds	until	their	total	Pell	at	School	Y reaches	$1,687.50	(and	the	student9s	total	for	the	award	year	reaches	150%	their	Scheduled	Award	amount	of $4,500).	Therefore,	for	the	second	payment	period	at	School	Y,	the	student	can	only	receive	$187.50	($1,687.50	3 $1,500	=	$187.50).

Note	that	if	the	student	received	a	Direct	Loan	at	School	X	and	now	wishes	to	borrow	a	Direct	Loan	at	School	Y, the	method	for	determining	the	remaining	eligibility	for	Direct	Loan	funds	in	transfer	student	situations	is	very different	from	the	method	of	determining	remaining	Pell	Grant	eligibility.	Refer	to	Volume	8	for	a	complete discussion	of	this	topic.

## NSLDS	Financial	Aid	History	and	Transfer	Monitoring

Before	disbursing	Title	IV	funds	to	a	transfer	student,	you	must	obtain	a	financial	aid	history	for	the	student	and	must inform	NSLDS	about	the	transfer	student	so	that	you	can	receive	updates	through	the	Transfer	Student	Monitoring Process.	The	financial	aid	history	will	identify	Pell	Grant	disbursements	that	the	student	received	at	other	schools,	along with	Title	IV	defaults	or	overpayments,	if	the	student	has	reached	or	exceeded	the	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits,	or	if the	student	has	reached	the	Pell	LEU	limit.	There	are	several	ways	for	you	to	get	a	student9s	financial	aid	history	from NSLDS.	You	can:

- Use	the	NSLDS	Financial	Aid	History	section	of	the	ISIR;
- Log	on	to	the	NSLDS	Professional	Access	website	and	access	the	data	online	for	a	student;
- For	multiple	students,	use	the	Financial	Aid	History	Report	(FAT001),	which	you	submit	from	the	Reports	tab	on	the NSLDS	site	(you	retrieve	the	results	through	SAIG);	or
- Send	a	batch	Transfer	Student	Monitoring/Financial	Aid	History	(TSM/FAH)	Inform	file	to	request	aid	history	data	for several	students.

The	&lt;NSLDS	Transfer	Student	Monitoring	&amp;	Financial	Aid	History	User	Guide=	provides	instructions	on	how	to	use	Transfer Student	Monitoring	(TSM)	online,	how	to	request	Financial	Aid	History	(FAH),	and	the	TSM/FAH	Batch	process.	This resource	is	published	in	the	Knowledge	Center	Library	in	the	"Publications	by	Resource	Type"	section	under	"NSLDS	User Resources."

If	a	student	has	not	self-identified	as	a	transfer	student,	data	on	the	student9s	ISIR	can	sometimes	alert	a	school	to	the fact	that	a	student	has	already	received	a	Pell	Grant	during	the	current	award	year.	Schools	should	examine	the	Pell payment	data	on	the	ISIR	generated	from	the	student9s	most	recent	transaction	to	see	if	the	percentage	of	the	Scheduled Award	used	for	the	award	year	is	greater	than	0.	If	the	ISIR	is	the	most	recent	and	the	percentage	of	the	Scheduled	Award used	for	the	award	year	is	greater	than	zero,	the	school	should	request	transfer	monitoring	of	that	student	and	wait	until it	has	received	the	results	of	that	process	through	NSLDS	before	creating	a	Pell	award	for	that	student	in	the	COD	System.

## Concurrent	Enrollment	and	Pell	Potential	Overaward

When	multiple	schools	report	disbursements	for	a	student	and	the	enrollment	dates	reported	are	within	30	calendar	days of	each	other,	the	COD	System	identifies	a	potential	concurrent	enrollment	and	sends	a	warning	message	to	all	schools involved.	The	COD	System	sends	the	school	that	submitted	the	second	or	subsequent	disbursement	information	a response	document	that	contains	warning	edit	69.	Warning	edit	69	informs	schools	that	submit	second	or	subsequent disbursement	information	that	Pell	disbursements	for	a	student	have	been	received	from	two	or	more	schools	and	the enrollment	dates	for	the	student	are	within	30	days	of	one	another.	The	COD	System	also	sends	a	multiple	reporting record	(MRR)	to	all	the	schools	with	accepted	disbursement	information	in	the	COD	system	for	the	student	and	the	award year.	The	MRR	alerts	the	schools	to	a	possible	overlap	in	enrollment.	The	Department	expects	all	schools	involved	to cooperate	in	resolving	the	concurrent	enrollment	issue.	To	help	facilitate	resolution,	the	MRR	contains	the	Pell	contact information,	as	reported	by	the	schools	to	the	COD	System,	for	the	schools	involved.

## Pell	Potential	Overaward	Process

A	student	may	receive	disbursements	from	more	than	one	school	during	an	award	year.	When	more	than	one	school reports	disbursements	for	a	student,	the	COD	System	checks	to	make	sure	the	student	has	not	received	more	than	100% (or	150%	if	qualifying	under	&lt;Year-round=	Pell)	of	the	student9s	eligibility	for	a	Pell	Grant.

If	the	COD	System	receives	disbursement	information	that	will	cause	a	student	to	receive	more	than	100%	(or	150%	if qualifying	under	&lt;Year-round=	Pell)	of	the	student9s	&lt;total	eligibility	used=	or	TEU,	the	student	has	entered	a	potential overaward	(POP)	situation.	Remember,	to	certify	eligibility	for	the	&lt;Year-round=	Pell	provision,	the	Additional	Eligibility Indicator	(AEI)	must	be	submitted	for	disbursements	exceeding	100%	of	the	Scheduled	Award	to	be	accepted	in	the	COD System.

The	COD	System	will	accept	the	disbursement	and	notify	the	schools	involved	in	the	POP	in	the	following	three	ways:

- COD	sends	the	school	that	submitted	the	disbursement	that	caused	the	student	to	exceed	the	100%	(or	150%	for &lt;Year-round=	Pell)	TEU	for	the	year	warning	edit	68	in	the	response	document.
- Weekly,	COD	sends	all	schools	that	have	accepted	and	posted	disbursements	for	students	in	a	POP	status	a	Pell	POP report	that	will	identify	the	student	and	schools	involved.
- COD	sends	all	schools	that	have	accepted	and	posted	disbursements	for	the	student	in	the	award	year	an	MRR containing	the	Pell	contact	information	for	the	schools	involved.

Warning	edit	68	informs	the	school	that	submitted	the	disbursement	that	caused	the	student	to	exceed	the	100%	(or 150%	if	qualifying	under	&lt;Year-round=	Pell)	TEU	for	the	year	that:

- Pell	disbursements	for	a	student	have	been	received	from	two	or	more	schools.
- The	student9s	TEU	is	greater	than	100.000%	or	150.000%	as	applicable.
- The	POP	situation	must	be	resolved	within	30	calendar	days.

During	the	30-day	period,	the	Department	expects	each	school	involved	in	the	potential	overaward	to	review	the student9s	award	and	disbursements	and	perform	the	proper	eligibility	calculations.	The	COD	System	will	accept	and	post disbursements	that	decrease	or	increase	the	student9s	year-to-date	disbursement	amount.	Students	will	be	removed	from POP	status	within	30	days	of	the	date	the	student	was	initially	placed	in	the	POP	if	the	student9s	TEU	becomes	100%	(or 150%	for	&lt;Year-round=	Pell)	or	below	based	on	downward	disbursement	adjustments	submitted	by	the	schools.	If	after	30 calendar	days	the	situation	has	not	been	resolved,	the	COD	System	generates	a	negative	disbursement	that	reduces	all accepted	and	posted	disbursements	to	$0	for	the	student	in	the	award	year	in	question	at	all	schools	involved.	Schools should	document	any	phone	calls,	emails,	and	letters	that	were	part	of	their	attempts	to	resolve	the	POP	with	the	student and	the	other	schools	involved	and	be	prepared	to	provide	that	documentation	to	COD	School	Relations,	if	requested.

Schools,	along	with	the	student,	must	work	together	to	resolve	the	POP	before	contacting	COD	School Relations	for	help. A	school	that	has	attempted	to	resolve	an	overaward	situation	with	the	other	schools	that	have submitted	disbursement	records	for	the	student	and	has	been	unable	to	arrive	at	a	satisfactory	solution	should	call	the COD	School	Relations	Center	to	request	&lt;escalated	mediation=.	The	school	should	be	prepared	to	provide	the	name	and social	security	number	of	the	student	involved.	The	COD	School	Relations	Center	will	review	the	POP	situation	and,	if necessary,	refer	the	case	to	the	Department	for	additional	action.

To	prevent	repeated	POP	situations	from	occurring,	schools	must:

- ensure	that	students	do	not	receive	Pell	awards	for	concurrent	enrollment	at	two	or	more	schools;
- take	action	when	they	receive	warning	notices	from	the	COD	System;	and
- correct	overaward	situations	prior	to	submitting	subsequent	disbursement	records	to	COD.

Schools	should	remember	that	failure	to	comply	with	these	requirements	may	call	into	question	a	school9s	administrative capability	and	fiscal	responsibility	and	might	eventually	result	in	the	Department	taking	action	to	limit,	suspend,	or terminate	a	school9s	participation	in	the	Title	IV	programs.

## Regarding	COD	processing	and	POPs:

- The	COD	System	accepts	disbursement	information	from	a	maximum	of	three	schools	for	a	student	in	a	POP situation.
- The	COD	System	does	not	prevent	the	same	schools	from	creating	another	POP	situation	for	the	same	student.
- Schools	do	not	need	to	request	post-deadline	processing	(extended	processing)	to	submit	upward	adjustment records	after	the	end	of	the	processing	year	to	correct	a	POP	situation.
- The	COD	System	accepts	downward	adjustments	to	disbursement	or	award	information	at	any	time.
- Disbursement	information	can	be	submitted	via	the	COD	website	for	those	schools	that	do	not	wish,	or	are	not	able, to	reopen	any	software	they	may	have	used	to	process	the	affected	award	year.

## Chapter	7

## Initial	Calculations,	Recalculations,	and	Overawards

## Initial	Pell	Calculation

An	initial	calculation	is	the	first	calculation	that	is	made	on	or	after	the	date	the	school	has	received	a	Departmentproduced	SAI	such	as	the	student9s	initial	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	with	an	official	SAI	and	a	Pell	Eligibility	Flag of	&lt;Y=.	This	may	be	from	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR,	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal,	or	FAFSA.gov.	The	initial calculation	uses	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	at	the	time	of	the	calculation.	If	you9ve	estimated	the	student9s eligibility	before	receiving	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	for	the	student,	you	must	confirm	prior	estimated eligibility	or	determine	the	student9s	eligibility	at	the	time	you	receive	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR.

If	a	school	performs	an	initial	calculation	before	a	student	has	registered	for	specific	classes,	the	school	may	rely	on	the student9s	general	estimate	of	intended	enrollment	when	performing	the	initial	calculation.	For	example,	a	school	could perform	an	initial	calculation	using	50%	enrollment	intensity	if	a	student	indicated	that	they	planned	to	enroll	half	time.

You	should	document	the	date	you	initially	calculate	a	student9s	Pell	Grant,	which	can	be	no	earlier	than	the	date	your school	received	a	Department-produced	SAI.	If	you	fail	to	document	the	date	of	the	initial	calculation,	you	must	use	the later	of:

- The	date	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	is	first	received	and	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	as	of	that date;	or
- The	date	the	student	enrolls.

Your	school	is	considered	to	have	received	the	ISIR	on	the	date	it	was	processed.	This	date	is	labeled	&lt;Processed	Date=	on the	ISIR.	In	the	case	of	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary,	your	school	is	considered	to	have	received	it	on	the	date	processed unless	you	document	a	later	date.	The	processing	date	on	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	is	the	date	above	the	SAI.

Pell	Recalculation	Due	to	Change	in	SAI	or	Other	Pell	Eligibility	Indicators

If	the	student9s	SAI	or	one	of	the	other	Pell	eligibility	indicators	change	due	to	corrections,	updates,	or	an	adjustment,	and the	change	would	alter	the	amount	of	the	Pell	award,	you	must	recalculate	the	Pell	award	for	the	entire	award	year.	In addition	to	the	SAI,	these	indicators	include	the	Max	Pell,	Minimum	Pell,	CFH,	or	IASG	indicators.	If	the	student	has received	more	than	their	Scheduled	Award	amount	due	to	the	recalculation,	then	the	student	has	received	an overpayment.	In	some	cases,	you	may	be	able	to	adjust	an	award	by	reducing	or	canceling	later	payments	to	the	student (see	Volume	4,	Chapter	3	for	more	information).

A	student	selected	for	verification	can	be	paid	based	on	the	corrected	output	document	you	receive	during	the &lt;verification	extension=	(120	days	after	the	student9s	last	day	of	enrollment,	or	the	deadline	date	established	by	a	Federal Register	notice,	whichever	is	earlier).	For	example,	if	you	receive	a	reprocessed	ISIR	reflecting	the	results	of	the	student9s verification	during	the	extension	period	and	the	ISIR	has	a	lower	SAI	than	the	previous	ISIR	(increasing	the	student9s eligibility),	you	calculate	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	based	on	the	reprocessed	ISIR.

If	you	receive	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	with	a	SAI	different	from	the	one	you	used	for	the	payment calculation,	you	must	first	decide	which	document	is	valid.	If	the	new	information	is	the	correct	information,	the	new FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	is	the	valid	record.	In	most	cases,	you	must	recalculate	the	student9s	Pell	award	for the	entire	award	year	based	on	the	new	SAI.	For	more	information	on	FAFSA	Submission	Summaries,	ISIRs,	and	SAI,	see the	Application	and	Verification	Guide.

Pell	Recalculation	3	Change	in	SAI

## Pell	Recalculation	Due	to	Change	in	Enrollment	Intensity

The	process	for	recalculating	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	award	due	to	changes	in	enrollment	intensity	depends	on	when	the change	occurs.

Pell	Recalculation	3	Change	in	Enrollment

## 34	CFR	690.80(b)

## Change	in	Enrollment	Intensity	Between	Academic	Terms

In	a	credit-hour	program	that	uses	terms,	you	must	calculate	a	student9s	payment	for	each	term	based	on	the	enrollment intensity	for	that	term.	For	example,	if	a	student	attended	full	time	for	the	first	term	and	then	enrolled	less	than	full	time in	the	second	term,	you	must	use	the	less-than-full-time	enrollment	intensity	to	calculate	the	student9s	payment	for	the second	term.

Change	in	Enrollment	Intensity	Within	a	Payment	Period	Before	a	Student	Begins	Attendance	in	All	Classes

You	must	report	changes	to	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity	to	NSLDS	in	a	timely	manner.	Any	change	requiring	a recalculation	of	an	award	may	also	require	an	update	to	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity.	If	the	student	doesn9t	begin attendance	in	all	classes	for	a	payment	period,	resulting	in	a	change	in	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity,	you must recalculate	the	student9s	award	for	that	payment	period	based	on	the	lower	enrollment	intensity.	A	student	is	considered to	have	begun	attendance	in	all	classes	if	the	student	attends	at	least	one	day	of	each	class	whose	credits	are	counted	for purposes	of	determining	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	for	Pell	Grant	eligibility.	Note	that	clock-hour	and	non-term programs	are	always	based	on	full-time	enrollment	intensity	for	Pell.

Your	school	must	have	a	procedure	in	place	to	know	whether	a	student	has	begun	attendance	in	all	classes	for	purposes of	the	Pell	Grant	program.	The	Department	does	not	dictate	the	method	a	school	uses	to	document	that	a	student	has begun	attendance.	However,	a	student	is	considered	not	to	have	begun	attendance	in	any	class	in	which	the	school	is unable	to	document	that	attendance.

If	you	recalculate	a	Pell	award	because	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	has	changed,	you	must	also	consider	any changes	in	the	student9s	costs	at	that	time.	For	example,	if	a	student	enrolls	full	time	for	the	first	semester	and	then	drops to	less	than	half	time	during	that	semester,	the	student9s	costs	will	change,	because	only	certain	cost	components	are allowed	for	less-than-half-time	students.	However,	the	COA	components	for	a	less-than-half-time	student	must	still	be based	on	the	costs	for	a	full-time	student	for	a	full	academic	year	when	calculating	the	student9s	less-than-half-time enrollment	intensity	and	Pell	Grant	award.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	7,	Example	1:	Enrollment	Intensity	Change	Pell	Recalculation

A	student	registers	for	a	full-time	course	load	(15	credit	hours)	and	their	school	makes	an	initial	disbursement	on that	basis	10	days	before	the	first	term	starts.	When	the	term	starts,	the	student	only	begins	attendance	in	three classes	(9	credit	hours).	The	school	must	recalculate	the	student9s	Pell	award	based	on	the	lower	enrollment intensity.	Any	difference	between	the	amount	the	student	received	and	the	new	recalculated	award	is	an overpayment	for	which	the	student	is	responsible.	See	Volume	4,	Chapter	3	for	more	detail	on	overpayments.

The	regulations	don9t	require	recalculation	of	Pell	Grant	awards	based	on	changes	in	enrollment	intensity	during	a payment	period after	the	student	has	begun	attendance	in	all	their	classes .	However,	your	school may have	a policy	of	recalculating	awards	in	this	situation.	Your	school9s	recalculation	policy	must	be	documented	in	writing,	must consider	any	changes	in	the	student9s	COA,	and	must	be	applied	consistently	to	all	students	in	a	program.	If	your	school chooses	to	recalculate	for	a	student	whose	enrollment	intensity	increases,	your	school	must	also	recalculate	for	a	student whose	enrollment	intensity	decreases.

Your	school9s	policy	may	set	a	date	after	which	Pell	Grants	will	not	be	recalculated	for	enrollment	intensity	changes	during a	payment	period.	This	date	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	the	"Pell	recalculation	date"	or	"PRD."	For	example,	you	could establish	a	policy	that	you	will	recalculate	Pell	awards	only	for	enrollment	intensity	changes	that	occur	up	to	the &lt;add/drop=	date	of	a	term.	If	you	establish	a	policy	that	Pell	Grants	will	not	be	recalculated	after	a	certain	date,	the	policy must	be	applied	in	all	cases,	even	when	there	is	compressed	coursework.

Note	that	a	school	may	establish	more	than	one	PRD	within	the	same	payment	period.	For	example,	if	a	term	is	divided into	two	or	more	modules,	a	school	could	establish	a	PRD	within	each	module.	However,	in	this	case	only	one	PRD	will apply	to	a	student,	and	that	will	be	the	PRD	for	the	latest	class	or	module	in	which	the	student	begins	attendance.	Once the	school	determines	which	PRD	applies	to	the	student,	the	school	must	go	back	to	the	beginning	of	the	term	and	review which	courses	the	student	dropped,	added,	or	completed	up	until	the	student9s	PRD	to	calculate	the	student9s	Pell	Grant enrollment	intensity.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	7,	Example	2:	Multiple	Pell	Recalculation	Dates

A	school	uses	multiple	Pell	recalculation	dates	within	a	payment	period	and	must	recalculate	Pell	up	to	the	Pell recalculation	date	for	the	last	class	or	module	in	which	the	student	begins	attendance.	The	fall	semester	is	divided into	two	modules.	The	school	establishes	one	PRD	in	each	module,	and	a	third	PRD	for	the	full	semester:

Module	1	PRD:	September	7

Full	Semester	PRD:	September	21

Module	2	PRD:	November	1

As	of	the	Full	Semester	PRD	(September	21),	a	student	had	begun	attendance	in	four	classes	(12	credit	hours)	for the	full	semester.

On	October	3,	the	student	drops	two	classes	(6	credit	hours).	On	October	20,	the	student	enrolls	and	begins attendance	in	a	3-credit-hour	class	in	Module	2.	As	of	the	Module	2	PRD	(November	1),	the	student	is	enrolled	for and	has	begun	attendance	in	nine	credit	hours.

In	this	example,	the	Module	2	PRD	(November	1)	applies	to	the	student,	so	the	student's	final	Pell	Grant enrollment	intensity	is	based	on	9	credits	(9	÷	12	=	75%).	If	the	student	had	not	enrolled	and	begun	attendance in	the	class	in	Module	2,	the	Full	Semester	PRD	(September	21)	would	apply,	and	the	student's	final	Pell	Grant enrollment	intensity	would	have	been	full	time.

If	your	school	has	a	policy	of	recalculating	Pell	Grant	awards	for	a	student	whose	projected	enrollment	intensity	has changed	as	of	your	established	PRD	(if	the	student	began	attendance	in	all	classes),	and	if	the	initial	calculation	of	the student's	Pell	Grant	occurred before the	recalculation	date,	the	recalculation	is	based	on	the	student's	new	enrollment intensity	as	of	the	recalculation	date.

In	some	cases,	a	student	may	not	be	enrolled	in	any	classes	as	of	a	school's	PRD,	but	the	student	enrolls	later	during	the payment	period	(for	example,	in	the	second	module	of	a	term).	Since	there	is	no	Pell	Grant	enrollment	intensity	of	"zero," in	this	circumstance	the	student	remains	Pell-eligible	based	on	the	initial	Pell	Grant	calculation	(if	the	student	began attendance	in	all	classes	on	which	the	enrollment	intensity	for	the	initial	calculation	was	based),	and	the	recalculation	is based	on	the	student's	enrollment	intensity	at	the	time	they	begin	enrollment	later	in	the	term.

The	initial	calculation	of	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	may	in	some	cases	occur after a	school's	PRD	for	a	term,	including	a	term with	compressed	coursework.	In	this	circumstance,	you	must	use	the	student9s	effective	enrollment	intensity	on	the	date of	the	initial	calculation,	and	there	is	no	recalculation	of	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	for	the	term	due	to	a	subsequent	change in	enrollment	intensity,	if	the	student	began	attendance	in	each	class.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	7,	Example	3:	Enrollment	Intensity	Change	Within	the	Payment	Period

A	student	registers	for	15	credit	hours	which	is	full	time	and	100%	enrollment	intensity.	Their	school	initially calculates	a	full-time	award,	based	on	its	definition	of	full-time	enrollment	as	12	or	more	credits	for	financial	aid purposes.	The	student	begins	attending	all	classes	but	subsequently	drops	two	classes	(6	credits)	bringing	their enrollment	down	to	9	credit	hours,	or	75%	enrollment	intensity.	The	school	does	not	recalculate	Pell	Grant	awards based	on	enrollment	intensity	changes	during	a	payment	period,	so	the	student	may	still	be	paid	based	on	fulltime	enrollment	if	the	student	is	otherwise	eligible	for	payment.

If	the	school	did	not	receive	the	student9s	first	processed	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	with	an	official SAI	until	after	the	student	dropped	to	75%	enrollment	intensity,	the	Pell	initial	calculation	would	be	based	on	the student9s	enrollment	intensity	at	the	time	the	school	received	the	output	document,	which	was	75%.

If	the	school	had	a	policy	of	recalculating	Pell	Grant	awards	if	a	student9s	enrollment	intensity	for	a	payment period	has	changed	as	of	a	specified	recalculation	date,	and	if	the	student	had	dropped	to	75%	enrollment intensity	as	of	that	date,	the	school	would	recalculate	the	student9s	award	based	on	75%	enrollment	intensity.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	7,	Example	4:	Enrollment	Intensity	Change	Between	Payment	Periods

A	student	registers	for	15	credit	hours,	which	is	full	time	and	100%	enrollment	intensity	because	the	institution defines	full-time	enrollment	as	12	or	more	credits	for	financial	aid	purposes.	The	school	initially	calculates	a	fulltime	Pell	Grant	award	for	the	fall	and	spring	semesters.	Each	semester	is	divided	into	two	8-week	modules	that are	combined	and	treated	as	a	single	16-week	standard	term.	The	student	begins	attendance	in	all	classes	in	the fall.

In	the	spring	semester,	the	student	is	not	enrolled	in	any	classes	during	the	first	8-week	module	or	any	classes that	span	the	entire	16-week	semester.	However,	the	student	is	enrolled	in	two	3-credit	courses	during	the	second 8-week	module.

The	school9s	Pell	Grant	recalculation	date	for	the	spring	semester	is	during	the	first	8-week	module.	Although	the student	is	not	enrolled	in	any	classes	as	of	the	recalculation	date,	their	enrollment	during	the	second	module	of the	semester	allows	them	to	be	paid	up	to	their	original	full-time	enrollment	status	as	determined	by	the	initial Pell	Grant	calculation.	However,	because	the	student	is	enrolled	for	only	six	hours	in	the	second	module,	the school	pays	the	student	at	50%	enrollment	intensity.	No	further	adjustments	to	the	student's	award	will	be	made if	there	are	subsequent	enrollment	intensity	changes	during	the	term.

If	the	student9s	payment	for	the	term	is	being	disbursed	in	a	subsequent	payment	period,	you	may	pay	the	student	only for	the	coursework	completed	in	the	term	(including	earned	Fs).	Additional	information	about	retroactive	payments	is available	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2.

In	the	case	of	programs	offered	with	compressed	coursework	or	modules	within	the	terms,	your	school	may	adopt	a	policy of	setting	the	PRD	based	on	the	add/drop	date	of	the	last	class	in	which	the	student	is	enrolled,	or	is	expected	to	enroll, for	the	term.	In	this	circumstance,	your	school	must	consider	all	adjustments	to	the	enrollment	intensity,	both	increases and	decreases,	up	to	the	add/drop	date	of	the	last	class	in	which	the	student	begins	attendance.

If	you	don9t	establish	a	policy	of	recalculating	based	on	changes	in	enrollment	intensity	that	occur	during	a	payment period,	a	student	who	begins	attendance	in	all	classes	would	be	paid	based	on	the	initial	calculation,	even	if	their enrollment	intensity	changes	before	the	disbursement	is	made.	If	the	student	withdraws	from	all	classes	(or	doesn9t	begin attending	any	classes),	you	must	follow	the	procedures	discussed	in	Volume	5.

## Pell	Recalculation	Due	to	Change	in	COA

When	a	student9s	COA	changes	during	the	award	year,	and	their	enrollment	intensity	remains	the	same,	you	may	(but	are not	required	to)	establish	a	policy	under	which	you	recalculate	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	award.	Once	established,	you	must consistently	apply	such	a	recalculation	policy	to	all	students	in	the	program.

## Tuition	and	Fee	Charges	and	Recalculation

If	your	school	recalculates	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	due	to	a	change	in	enrollment	intensity	but	continues	to	charge	tuition and	fees	for	credit	hours	that	are	no	longer	included	in	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	for	Pell	Grant	purposes,	this does	not	affect	the	requirement	to	recalculate	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	award.

For	example,	if	a	student	enrolls	as	a	full-time	student	with	12	credits,	but	never	starts	attendance	in	a	3-credit	class	that starts	after	the	school9s	&lt;add/drop=	date,	the	student9s	award	must	be	recalculated	based	on	9	credits	or	75%	enrollment intensity.	This	is	true,	even	though	the	school	charges	tuition	for	any	classes	dropped	after	the	&lt;add/	drop=	date,	and therefore	continues	to	charge	the	student	for	12	credits.

## Recalculation	of	Pell	Grant	Awards	for	Students	Who	Graduate	Early	From	a	Clock-Hour	Program

Under	the	regulations	that	govern	the	treatment	of	Title	IV	funds	when	a	student	withdraws,	a	student	who	completes	all the	requirements	for	graduation	from	a	program	before	completing	the	days	or	hours	they	were	scheduled	to	complete	is not	considered	to	have	withdrawn,	and	no	return	of	Title	IV	funds	calculation	is	required	(see	Volume	5	for	more	detail). However,	a	school	may	be	required	to	return	a	portion	of	the	Pell	Grant	funds	that	were	awarded	to	a	student	who successfully	completes	the	requirements	for	graduation	from	a	clock-hour	program	before	completing	the	number	of	clock hours	that	they	were	scheduled	to	complete.	Note	that	successfully	completed	clock	hours	may	include	a	limited	number of	clock	hours	for	which	the	student	was	granted	an	excused	absence	if	your	school	has	an	excused	absence	policy	that meets	the	requirements	described	in	34	CFR	668.4(e).	For	more	information,	see	the	discussion	of	"Excused	absences	in clock-hour	programs"	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1.

A	student's	eligibility	to	receive	Title	IV	aid	for	a	clock-hour	program	is	based,	in	part,	on	the	total	number	of	clock	hours in	the	program.	If	a	school	allows	a	student	to	graduate	from	a	clock-hour	program	without	completing	all	the	originally established	hours	for	the	program,	the	school	has	effectively	shortened	the	program	length	and	reduced	a	student's	Title IV	aid	eligibility	for	the	program.	In	this	circumstance,	the	school	must	recalculate	the	student's	Pell	Grant	award	based	on the	number	of	hours	the	student	completed.	The	school	must	return	to	the	Department	the	difference	between	the recalculated	award	amount	and	the	Pell	Grant	amount	that	the	student	originally	received.	(For	a	student	who	received	a Direct	Loan,	the	school	must	also	prorate	the	student's	annual	loan	limit	in	this	situation,	or,	if	the	loan	limit	was	originally subject	to	proration,	recalculate	the	original	prorated	loan	limit.	See	Volume	8	for	more	information.)

## Volume	7,	Chapter	7,	Example	5:	Pell	Recalculation	for	Early	Graduation	From	a	Clock-Hour	Program

Consider	a	student	who	enrolls	in	a	900	clock-hour	program,	with	the	academic	year	defined	as	900	clock	hours and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	school	assumes	that	the	student	will	complete	900	clock	hours,	and	the student9s	Scheduled	Award	is	$7,500,	paid	in	disbursements	of	$3,750	in	each	payment	period	(see	Chapter	1	of Volume	3	for	guidance	on	determining	payment	periods).

The	school	considers	the	student	to	have	met	the	requirements	for	graduation	from	the	program	after	the	student has	completed	only	750	of	the	originally	scheduled	900	clock	hours.	As	soon	as	practicable	after	determining	that the	student	will	meet	the	graduation	requirements,	the	school	must	recalculate	the	student's	Pell	Grant	award	as if	the	student	had	been	enrolled	in	a	750	clock-hour	program.	Although	the	school	will	recalculate	the	student's award	using	Formula	4	(as	described	in	Chapter	4),	in	this	circumstance	only	the	number	of	clock	hours	in	the payment	periods	are	considered.	There	is	no	comparison	of	hours	and	weeks	fractions,	as	is	normally	required with	Formula	4.

The	school	determines	the	recalculated	award	amount	for	each	payment	period	by	multiplying	the	student's

$7,500	Pell	Grant	award	by	375	(the	number	of	clock	hours	in	each	payment	period	based	on	the	total	of	750 hours	that	the	student	completed),	then	dividing	the	result	by	900	(the	number	of	clock	hours	in	the	program's academic	year).	This	results	in	two	recalculated	disbursements	of	$3,125	each,	for	a	total	award	of	$6,250.	The school	reduces	the	original	first	and	second	disbursements	by	$625,	then	returns	the	total	difference	of	$1,250	to the	Department.	Note	that	the	school	3	not	the	student	3	is	responsible	for	returning	the	excess	Pell	Grant	funds	in this	situation.

The	recalculation	requirement	described	above	applies only to	clock-hour	programs,	and	it	applies	regardless	of	the length	of	the	program	or	remaining	portion	of	a	program.	For	example,	if	a	student	who	received	Pell	Grant	funds	for enrollment	in	a	600	clock-hour	program	meets	the	graduation	requirements	after	completing	only	500	clock	hours,	the student's	Pell	Grant	award	must	be	recalculated.

## Overawards	and	Overpayments

A	Pell	Grant	overaward	exists	when	the	award	is	greater	than	the	amount	for	which	the	student	is	eligible.	An	overaward only	becomes	an	overpayment	if	a	school	cannot	correct	the	overaward	before	all	funds	are	disbursed	to	the	student.

A	correctly	determined	Pell	Grant,	based	on	eligibility	criteria	described	in	Chapter	2,	is	never	adjusted	to	account	for other	forms	of	aid.	Therefore,	if	a	student9s	aid	package	exceeds	his	or	her	need,	you	must	attempt	to	eliminate	the overaward	by	reducing	other	Title	IV	aid	or	other	aid	your	school	controls.	You	may	not	reduce	a	student9s	correctly awarded	and	disbursed	Pell	Grant	to	address	overpayments	in	other	programs.

Note: It	is	possible	for	a	correctly	awarded	Pell	Grant	to	exceed	the	student9s	financial	need.	For	example,	a student9s	SAI	may	exceed	their	COA,	but	the	student	may	still	qualify	for	a	Minimum	Pell	Grant,	based	on	that	set of	eligibility	criteria.	Further,	a	student	may	be	eligible	for	a	Max	Pell	Grant	under	the	Special	Rule	regardless	of their	SAI.	In	these	situations,	the	correctly	determined	Pell	Grant	is	not	considered	an	overaward,	but	the	student is	not	eligible	for	any	other	need-based	Title	IV	aid.	See	Volume	3,	Chapter	3	for	additional	packaging	guidance.

If	a	student	received	more	Pell	Grant	funds	than	they	were	eligible	for	because	their	eligibility	for	the	grant	decreased, you	can	try	to	eliminate	the	overpayment	by	adjusting	later	disbursements	for	the	award	year.	Additionally,	a	Pell	Grant awarded	to	an	ineligible	student	or	based	on	an	incorrect	enrollment	intensity	greater	than	that	for	which	the	student	is enrolled	is	an	overaward.	See	Volume	4,	Chapter	3	for	additional	guidance	on	resolving	overawards.

## Pell	Grant	Overawards

A	Pell	Grant	overaward	can	be	caused	by	a	school	making	an	error	in	determining	Pell	Grant	eligibility.	For	example,	the school	may	use	the	wrong	SAI	or	fail	to	limit	the	award	by	the	student9s	COA.	A	Pell	Grant	overaward	can	also	result	if	the student	enters	incorrect	data	on	the	FAFSA	form	and	the	SAI	derived	from	the	incorrect	data	is	lower	than	it	should	be	(for more	detail	about	the	FAFSA	form	and	SAI	data,	see	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide).	A	Pell	overaward	also	exists	if a	student	scheduled	to	receive	a	Pell	Grant	fails	to	begin	classes	or	is	otherwise	determined	to	be	ineligible	for	Title	IV Funds	(for	example,	having	exceeded	the	Pell	LEU).	Finally,	an	overaward	exists	whenever	a	student	is	scheduled	to receive	or	is	receiving	a	Pell	Grant	for	attendance	at	two	or	more	schools	concurrently.	All	these	Pell	Grant	overawards must	be	corrected.

This	is	not	an	exclusive	list	of	all	the	ways	in	which	a	Pell	Grant	may	be	overawarded.	In	addition	to	avoiding	these mistakes,	schools	should	also	be	sure	to	submit	timely	Pell	actual	disbursement	records	to	COD,	according	to	the	Annual Deadline	Date	Notice	as	published	in	the	Knowledge	Center.

## 34	CFR	690.79

## Declining	and/or	Returning	Pell	Funds

A	student	may	decline	or	return	all	or	part	of	a	disbursement	of	Pell	Grant	funds	that	they	are	eligible	to	receive	or	have received.	However,	returns	may	only	be	made	in	the	same	award	year	as	the	funds	were	received.	You	are	not	required	to comply	with	a	student9s	request	to	decline	a	Pell	Grant	disbursement	that	has	already	been	applied	to	the	student9s account	for	institutional	charges.	This	should	be	a	rare	action	and	need	not	be	advertised	as	a	possibility	by	your	school. For	more	detail	on	the	requirements	of	declining	or	returning	Pell	funds,	see	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-12-18.

## Chapter	8 Pell	Grant	Lifetime	Eligibility	Used	(LEU)

## Duration	of	Eligibility

Per	the	Consolidated	Appropriations	Act,	2012,	a	student9s	maximum	duration	of	Pell	eligibility	is	six	Scheduled	Awards,	as measured	by	the	percentage	of	&lt;Lifetime	Eligibility	Used=	(LEU)	field	in	COD	(one	Scheduled	Award	equals	100%	LEU).	A student	is	ineligible	to	receive	further	Pell	Grant	funds	if	they	have	reached	or	exceeded	the	600%	limit.	This	limitation includes	all	grants	disbursed	since	the	beginning	of	the	program	(1973-74).

Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-13-14

Electronic	Announcement	April	18,	2014

The	Department	provides	weekly	Pell	LEU	reports	through	the	SAIG	Mailbox	under	Message	Class	PGLEXXOP	(where	XX	= the	year)	for	your	Pell-eligible	students	(and	students	who	listed	your	school	code	on	their	FAFSA	form)	who	have	a	Pell LEU	greater	than	or	equal	to	450%.	The	COD	website	will	show	the	current	Pell	LEU	level	for	all	aid	recipients	(updated	as transactions	are	processed).	COD	also	provides	the	LEU	for	the	Pell	Multiple	Reporting	Record	(MRR),	Pell	Reconciliation Report,	and	Pell	Year-to-Date	file.

Students	will	fall	into	one	of	the	following	categories:

- Student	not	on	report (Code	&lt;N=	on	the	student9s	ISIR	under	Lifetime	Limit	Flag):	Students	in	this	category	have LEU	of	less	than	400%.	These	students9	Pell	awards	will	be	awarded	as	normal,	since	even	if	they	receive	a	full Scheduled	Award,	they	will	not	go	over	the	600%	LEU	maximum.
- LEU	greater	than	400%	but	less	than	or	equal	to	500% (Code	&lt;H=	on	the	student9s	ISIR	under	Lifetime	Limit Flag):	Students	in	this	category	will	likely	have	Scheduled	Award	eligibility	for	2025-26.	However,	a	student9s	202526	Pell	eligibility	may	be	reduced	if,	for	example,	another	Pell	disbursement	is	reported	after	a	report	has	been created,	putting	the	student9s	2025-26	baseline	LEU	over	500%.
- LEU	greater	than	500%	but	less	than	600% (Code	&lt;C=	on	the	student9s	ISIR	under	Lifetime	Limit	Flag):	These students	will	not	have	full	Pell	eligibility	for	2025-26	since	their	baseline	LEU	has	less	than	100%	remaining.
- LEU	600%	or	higher (Code	&lt;E=	on	the	student9s	ISIR	under	Lifetime	Limit	Flag):	These	students	will	have	no	Pell eligibility	remaining,	as	they	have	already	met	or	exceeded	the	maximum	LEU	amount.

To	aid	in	identifying	students	who	are	approaching	their	LEU	limits,	COD	returns	warning	code	177	or	178	when	a student9s	Pell	LEU	is	near	or	exceeds	600%.	COD	has	a	hard	reject	(Edit	201)	for	Pell	Grant	actual	disbursements	with	a Pell	Grant	LEU	greater	than	600%.	Also,	you	will	be	able	to	see	this	data	in	the	Common	Record	Response,	and	LEU	is	also visible	in	the	NSLDS	system.	The	FAFSA	Processing	System	(FPS)	reports	the	Pell	Grant	LEU	limit	flags	and	percentages	on FAFSA	Submission	Summaries	and	ISIRs.	COD	calculates	a	student9s	LEU	to	three	decimal	places,	and	you	may	round awards	as	described	in	Chapter	4	of	this	volume.	However,	you	may	not	round	up	if	that	would	cause	the	student	to exceed	either	their	Scheduled	Award	or	600%	LEU.

To	calculate	an	award	for	a	student	whose	LEU	level	will	reduce	the	student9s	eligibility	(i.e.,	an	LEU	greater	than	450% but	less	than	600%),	you	must	first	check	the	most	current	LEU	level	in	COD.	Subtract	the	LEU	percentage	from	600%, then	multiply	the	student9s	Scheduled	Award	by	the	resulting	percentage.	For	example,	if	a	student	has	533%	LEU	in	COD, your	school	will	subtract	533%	from	600%,	leaving	the	student	with	67%	of	a	Scheduled	Award	remaining.	If	the	student9s Scheduled	Award	is	$7,455,	your	school	multiplies	$7,455	by	0.67,	which	equals	$4,994.85.	This	amount	is	then	disbursed per	the	normal	Pell	formula	and	payment	period	rules.	If	your	school	only	disburses	funds	in	whole	dollars,	you	will truncate	the	amount	to	$4,994	(rather	than	rounding	up	to	$4,995,	as	this	would	put	the	student	over	600%	LEU).

For	students	whose	eligibility	is	less	than	a	full	Scheduled	Award,	you	award	the	student	a	Pell	Grant	as	you	would	for	a transfer	student	who	received	Pell	at	another	school	during	the	same	award	year.	That	is,	you	determine	the	student9s remaining	Pell	Grant	eligibility	as	a	percentage	of	LEU	and	then	award	each	payment	until	that	eligibility	is	used	(see	the discussion	in	Chapter	6	of	this	volume).

Pell	Grant	and	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	Service	Grant	LEU

Prior	to	the	2024-25	award	year,	the	Pell	Grant	and	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	Service	Grant	(IASG)	were	separate	programs and	LEUs	were	tracked	independently	for	each	program.	In	the	Spring	of	2024,	any	student	who	received	IASG	funds	had their	IASG	LEU	percentage	converted	to	and	combined	with	a	Pell	Grant	LEU	percentage.	A	student	whose	newly combined	Pell	Grant	LEU	percentage	reaches	or	exceeds	the	600%	limit	will	not	be	eligible	for	Pell	Grant	funds.	However, a	student	whose	newly	combined	Pell	LEU	exceeds	600%	is	not	considered	to	have	received	a	Pell	Grant	overaward.

| Prior Pell LEU   | Prior IASG LEU   | Combined Pell LEU   | Remaining Eligibility?   |

HEA	Section	401(c)

Timely	Pell	Grant	Reporting	Requirements

Because	of	Pell	Grant	Lifetime	Eligibility	Used	(LEU)	monitoring,	it	is	important	to	submit	Pell	Grant	disbursement information	in	a	timely	manner.	You	must	submit	Pell	Grant	disbursement	information	to	COD	no	later	than	15	calendar days	after	making	a	disbursement	or	adjustment.	To	ensure	you	and	other	schools	have	the	most	accurate	information available	about	students9	LEUs,	you	should	submit	information	to	COD	as	early	as	possible	in	the	required	15-day	time frame.	Doing	so	may	help	prevent	an	overaward.	Failure	to	submit	the	data	within	the	15	days	could	result	in	the Department	disallowing	the	disbursement.

NSLDS	Reporting	Requirements	for	Pell

## Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-14-07

Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-14-17

## Changes	in	LEU

A	student9s	LEU	changes	whenever	they	receive	a	Pell	Grant	disbursement	and	may	change	any	time	a	student9s Scheduled	Award	is	adjusted	(up	or	down).	It	may	also	change	through	an	LEU	adjustment	based	on	an	LEU	Dispute, Closed	School	Restoration,	Restoration	for	Eligible	Loan	Discharge,	or	other	adjustment	type	deemed	necessary	by	the Department.

A	student9s	Pell	Grant	LEU	can	limit	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	eligibility	for	an	award	year.	For	example,	since	the	maximum LEU	is	600%,	if	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	award	originally	was	calculated	based	on	an	LEU	of	550%,	then	that	student9s	award would	be	limited	to	50%	of	the	Scheduled	Award.	A	change	to	a	disbursement	in	the	current	or	previous	award	year	may alter	a	student9s	LEU.	For	details	on	LEU	limitations,	see	the	Pell	Grant	Lifetime	Eligibility	Used	guidance	earlier	in	this chapter.

When	a	school	becomes	aware	that	a	student9s	LEU	has	changed,	it	should	determine	whether	the	adjustment	affects	the student9s	eligibility	for	a	Pell	Grant	in	the	current	or	most	recently	completed	award	year.

If	the	student	becomes	eligible	for	additional	Pell	Grant	funds	due	to	a	change	to	the	student9s	LEU,	the	school	must	make a	correction	to	the	student9s	award	and	make	any	disbursements	of	Pell	Grant	funds	for	which	the	student	is	now	eligible and	that	the	school	is	permitted	to	make	under	the	late	and	retroactive	disbursement	requirements	(for	more	detail	on disbursement	requirements	and	timing,	see	Volume	4,	Chapter	2).

## Minimum	Pell	Grant	and	LEU

Under	HEA	section	401(a)(2)(F),	the	minimum	award	is	set	at	10%	of	the	maximum	award	appropriated	each	year, rounded	to	the	nearest	$5.	There	is,	however,	no	de	minimis	award	amount	for	purposes	of	determining	a	student9s	award because	of	the	600%	LEU	limitation.	Therefore,	an	otherwise	eligible	student	with	even	a	very	small	remaining	LEU	is eligible	to	receive	the	calculated	amount	of	the	Pell	Grant,	up	to	the	LEU.

## Volume	7,	Chapter	8,	Example	1:	Minimum	Pell	Grant	and	LEU

A	full-time	student	with	a	Scheduled	Award	equal	to	$7,500	with	a	LEU	of	599.500%	would	be	eligible	for	the remaining	0.500%	which	is	$37.50	(if	your	school	only	disburses	in	whole	dollars,	this	amount	must	be	truncated to	$37,	because	$38	would	exceed	the	student9s	LEU).

## Pell	LEU	Restoration

In	2017,	following	several	cases	of	closed	schools,	the	Department	began	restoring	Federal	Pell	Grant	eligibility	for	Pell Grant	recipients	who	were	unable	to	complete	their	course	of	study	due	to	the	closing	of	a	school.	This	process	is	known as	&lt;Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Closed	Schools=.

This	expanded	authority	is	known	as	&lt;Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Eligible	Loan	Discharge=. The	Department	implemented	changes	in	the	COD	System	to	accommodate	this	new	authority	on	July	30,	2023.

## Electronic	Announcement	posted	July	20,	2023

A	closed	school	may	be	considered	for	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Closed	Schools	process	if	all	the	following	are	true:

- The	school's	main	location	is	officially	closed	with	the	Department;
- The	school	closed	after	1994	(i.e.,	1995	to	present);
- All	final	disbursements	have	been	submitted	to	the	COD	system	and	accepted	by	the	Department;
- All	final	enrollment	data	has	been	submitted	to	NSLDS	so	that	the	Department	may	determine	if	students	are	eligible for	restoration;	and
- The	school	has	completed	the	close-out	process	with	the	Department.

A	student	may	be	eligible	for	restoration	under	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Closed	Schools	process	if	all	the	following	are true:

- The	student	received	a	Pell	Grant	disbursement	at	an	eligible	closed	school	(see	criteria	for	an	eligible	closed	school above);
- The	student	did	not	complete	their	program	at	the	closed	school;	and
- The	student	had	a	valid	enrollment	status	at	the	closed	school	within	two	years	of	the	school9s	closure.

A	student	may	be	eligible	for	restoration	under	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Eligible	Loan	Discharge	process	if	the	following are	true:

- The	student	received	an	eligible	loan	discharge	on	or	after	July	1,	2017;	and
- The	student	received	Pell	Grant	disbursement	for	the	same	OPEID	and	award	year	as	the	discharged	loan.

School	Impact	Due	to	Pell	LEU	Restorations

Schools	do	not	have	to	take	any	action	related	to	either	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Closed	Schools	or	the	Pell	LEU Restoration	for	Loan	Discharge	processing.	The	Department	has	modified	the	COD	system	to	restore	Pell	Grant	eligibility for	affected	students.

However,	if	a	student9s	eligibility	for	Pell	in	the	current	award	year	is	affected	by	an	LEU	adjustment,	the	school	will	be notified.	Notifications	of	Pell	eligibility	restoration	adjustments	for	students	associated	with	their	school	are	sent	through multiple	sources:

- COD	Warning	Edits	(#221	for	Closed	School	adjustments;	#229	for	Loan	Discharge	adjustments);
- Targeted	emails	with	instructions	to	download	a	list	of	affected	students	from	the	COD	Web;
- NSLDS	post	screening;
- Updated	LEU	within	response	file;	and
- Details	of	the	LEU	adjustment(s)	displayed	on	the	students9	Pell	LEU	History	screen	in	COD	Web.

Student	Impact	and	Eligibility	for	Pell	LEU	Restorations

Neither	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Closed	Schools	nor	the	Pell	LEU	Restoration	for	Eligible	Loan	Discharge	process requires	student	intervention.	Students	who	are	potentially	eligible	for	additional	Pell	because	some	or	all	their	Pell eligibility	has	been	restored	are	sent	a	targeted	email.

Standard-term,	credit-hour	programs,	including	subscription-based	programs,	with	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	(or waiver	applies).	For	a	program	with	a	traditional	academic	calendar,	the	program:

- must	have	an	academic	calendar	that	consists,	in	the	fall	through	spring,	of	two	semesters	or	trimesters,	or	three quarters	(note	that	summer	may	not	be	a	standard	term);

- must	measure	progress	in	credit	hours	and	must	define	full-time	enrollment	for	each	term	in	the	award	year	as	at least	12	credit	hours.

Other	programs	offered	in	standard	terms	may	use	Formula	1	if	they	start	the	terms	for	different	cohorts	of	students	on	a periodic	basis	(for	example,	monthly).	These	programs:

- must	have	an	academic	calendar	that	consists	exclusively	of	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters;
- must	have	at	least	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	any	two	semesters	or	trimesters	or	any	three	quarters;
- must	start	the	terms	for	different	cohorts	of	students	on	a	periodic	basis	(for	example,	monthly);
- must	not	allow	students	to	be	enrolled	in	overlapping	terms	and	the	students	must	stay	with	the	cohort	in	which	they start	unless	they	withdraw	from	a	term	(or	skip	a	term)	and	re-enroll	in	a	subsequent	term;	and
- must	define	full-time	enrollment	for	each	term	in	the	award	year	as	at	least	12	credit	hours	and	must	measure progress	in	credit	hours.

## Formula	3	Summary

Any	term-based,	credit-hour	program,	including	subscription-based	programs;	may	include	programs	that	qualify	for Formulas	1	and	2.

Step	1:	Determine	Enrollment	Intensity

Enrolled	credits	divided	by	full-time	minimum	credits.

Step	2:	Calculate	Pell	COA

Full-time,	full	academic	year	costs.

Cost	for	program	or	period	not	equal	to	academic	year	prorated.	Two	fractions	are	compared:

Hours	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Hours	to	which	the	costs	apply

Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the enrollment	period	to	which	the	costs	apply

The	entire	cost	is	multiplied	by	the	lesser	of	the	two	fractions	to	determine	Pell	COA.

## Step	3:	Determine	Annual	Award

If	the	student9s	enrollment	intensity	is	full	time,	the	annual	award	is	the	Scheduled	Award.	If	the	student9s enrollment	intensity	is	less	than	100%,	the	annual	award	is	the	Scheduled	Award	multiplied	by	the	enrollment intensity	percentage.

Step	4:	Determine	Payment	Periods

Payment	period	is	the	academic	term.

Step	5:	Calculate	Payment	for	a	Payment	Period

[(Annual	award	x	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	term)	÷	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s academic	year	definition]

Note:	A	single	disbursement	can9t	exceed	50%	of	the	annual	award.

## Formula	4	Summary

Clock-hour	programs	and	credit-hour	programs	without	terms,	residential	portion	of	non-term	correspondence	programs.

Step	1:	Determine	Enrollment	Intensity

At	least	half-time	or	less-than-half-time.

Step	2:	Calculate	Pell	COA

Full-time,	full	academic	year	costs.

Cost	for	program	or	period	not	equal	to	academic	year	prorated.	Two	fractions	compared:

Hours	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Hours	to	which	the	costs	apply

Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the enrollment	period	to	which	the	costs	apply

The	entire	cost	is	multiplied	by	the	lesser	of	the	two	fractions	to	determine	Pell	COA.

Step	3:	Determine	Annual	Award

Always	equal	to	Scheduled	Award.	Does	not	mean	students	are	always	considered	full-time.

Step	4:	Determine	Payment	Periods

Length	of	payment	period	measured	in	credit	or	clock	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional	time.	Minimum	of	two equal	payment	periods	required	for	programs	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	or	two	equal	payment	periods	in each	full	academic	year	(or	final	portion	longer	than	half	an	academic	year)	for	programs	longer	than	or	equal	to an	academic	year.

## Step	5:	Calculate	Payment	for	a	Payment	Period

Annual	award	multiplied	by	the	lesser	of:

The	number	of	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	payment	period	÷	The	number	of	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	program9s academic	year

OR

The	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	payment	period	÷	The	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in the	program9s	academic	year

Note:	A	single	disbursement	can9t	exceed	50%	of	the	annual	award.

## Formula	5A	Summary

Correspondence	programs	non-term	correspondence	component.	For	residential	portion,	use	Formula	4	to	calculate payment	periods	and	amounts.	The	schedule	for	the	submission	of	lessons	must	reflect	a	workload	of	at	least	12	hours	of preparation	per	week	of	instructional	time.

Step	1:	Determine	Enrollment	Intensity

Enrollment	intensity	is	never	more	than	50%.

Step	2:	Calculate	Pell	COA

Full-time,	full	academic	year	costs	(for	applicable	components).

Cost	for	program	or	enrollment	period	not	equal	to	academic	year	prorated	according	to	the	following	formula	for tuition	and	fees:

Costs	×	(Credit	hours	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Credit	hours	to	which	costs	apply)

Step	3:	Determine	Annual	Award

Annual	award	is	the	Scheduled	Award	multiplied	by	enrollment	intensity,	capped	at	50%.

Step	4:	Determine	Payment	Periods

Length	of	payment	period	measured	in	credit	hours.

The	first	payment	period	is	the	period	of	time	in	which	the	student	completes	the	lesser	of	the	first	half	of	the academic	year	or	the	first	half	of	the	program.	(First	payment	can	be	made	only	after	the	student	has	completed 25%	of	the	lessons	or	otherwise	completed	25%	of	the	work	scheduled,	whichever	comes	last.)

The	second	payment	period	is	the	period	of	time	in	which	the	student	completes	the	lesser	of	the	second	half	of the	academic	year	or	the	second	half	of	the	program.	(Second	payment	may	be	made	only	after	the	student	has submitted	75%	of	the	lessons	or	otherwise	completed	75%	of	the	work	scheduled,	whichever	comes	last.)

Step	5:	Calculate	Payment	for	a	Payment	Period

Annual	award	is	multiplied	by	the	lesser	of:

Number	of	credit	hours	in	the	payment	period	÷	Number	of	credit	hours	in	the	program9s	academic	year

OR

Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	payment	period	÷	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s	academic	year

Note:	A	single	disbursement	can9t	exceed	50%	of	the	annual	award.

Formula	5B	Summary

Programs	of	study	by	correspondence,	term	correspondence	component.	During	each	term,	the	written	schedule	for	the submission	of	lessons	must	reflect	a	workload	of	at	least	30	hours	of	preparation	per	semester	hour	or	at	least	20	hours	of preparation	per	quarter	hour.

Step	1:	Determine	Enrollment	Intensity

Enrollment	intensity	is	never	more	than	50%.

Step	2:	Calculate	Pell	COA

Full-time,	full	academic	year	costs	(for	applicable	components).

Cost	for	program	or	enrollment	period	not	equal	to	academic	year	prorated	according	to	the	following	formula	for tuition	and	fees:

Cost	×	(Credit	hours	in	program9s	definition	of	academic	year	÷	Credit	hours	to	which	costs	apply)

Step	3:	Determine	Annual	Award

Annual	award	is	the	Scheduled	Award	multiplied	by	enrollment	intensity,	capped	at	50%.

Step	4:	Determine	Payment	Periods

Length	of	payment	period	is	the	academic	term.

Step	5:	Calculate	Payment	for	a	Payment	Period

(Annual	award	x	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	term)	÷	Weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s	academic year	definition

When	there	is	a	residential	portion	in	a	term-based	correspondence	program,	Formula	3	is	used	to	calculate	the student9s	payment	for	a	payment	period	for	the	residential	portion.

Note:	A	single	disbursement	cannot	exceed	50%	of	the	annual	award.
