## Application	and	Verification	Guide

## Introduction

This	guide	is	intended	for	college	financial	aid	administrators	and	counselors	who	help	students	with	the	financial	aid process4completing	the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA ® )	form,	verifying	information,	and	making corrections	and	other	changes	to	the	information	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Throughout	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Handbook,	we	use	&lt;college,=	&lt;school,=	and	&lt;institution=	interchangeably	unless	a more	specific	use	is	given.	Similarly,	&lt;student,=	&lt;applicant,=	and	&lt;aid	recipient=	are	synonyms.	&lt;Parents=	in	this	volume refers	to	the	legal	parents	of	dependent	students,	and	&lt;you=	refers	to	the	primary	audience	of	the	Handbook:	financial	aid administrators	at	colleges.	&lt;We=	indicates	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	(the	Department,	ED),	and	&lt;federal	student aid=	and	&lt;Title	IV	aid=	are	synonymous	terms	for	the	financial	aid	offered	by	the	Department.

We	appreciate	any	comments	that	you	have	on	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide	(AVG),	as	well	as	all	the	volumes	of the	FSA	Handbook.	We	revise	the	text	based	on	questions	and	feedback	from	the	financial	aid	community,	so	please reach	out	to	us	about	how	to	improve	the	FSA	Handbook	through	the	&lt;Contact	Customer	Support=	feature	in	our	Partner Connect	Help	Center	clicking	on	&lt;FSA	Handbook=	under	the	Topic	section.

## FAFSA	Simplification	Act

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act,	passed	on	Dec.	27,	2020,	as	part	of	the	Consolidated	Appropriations	Act,	2021,	mandated	a significant	overhaul	of	federal	student	aid,	including	the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA ® )	form,	need analysis,	and	many	policies	and	procedures	for	schools	that	participate	in	the	Title	IV	programs.	FSA	implemented	the FAFSA	Simplification	Act	alongside	the	FAFSA	portion	of	the	Fostering	Undergraduate	Talent	by	Unlocking	Resources	for Education	(FUTURE)	Act	to	streamline	the	FAFSA	application	process.

## Changes	From	the	FUTURE	Act

The	Fostering	Undergraduate	Talent	by	Unlocking	Resources	for	Education	(FUTURE)	Act	authorized	a	direct	data exchange	3	the	FUTURE	Act	Direct	Data	Exchange	(FA-DDX)	3	with	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	(IRS)	to	facilitate completing	the	FAFSA	form.	The	previous	tool	to	transfer	U.S.	income	and	tax	information	from	the	IRS	3	the	IRS	Data Retrieval	Tool	(DRT)	3	was	retired	after	the	close	of	the	2023-24	application	cycle.	Implementation	of	the	FA-DDX eliminated	the	need	for	most	applicants	(and	their	spouse	or	parents)	to	self-report	their	income	and	tax	information reported	to	the	IRS.	Also,	federal	tax	information	(FTI)	that	is	transferred	via	the	FA-DDX	to	the	FAFSA	form	is	considered verified	for	Title	IV	purposes.

Unlike	with	the	IRS-DRT,	which	allowed	applicants	to	opt	in,	the	FA-DDX requires applicants	and	contributors	(student9s spouse	and/or	parents,	as	appropriate)	to	provide	consent	and	approval	for	the	Department	to	obtain	FTI	from	the	IRS	via the	FA-DDX	and	use	it	to	determine	the	student9s	eligibility	for	federal	student	aid.

## Other	Changes

Throughout	the	AVG,	all	dates,	pertinent	tax	return	and	schedule	information,	along	with	various	resources	and	references have	been	updated	to	support	the	requirements	associated	with	the	2025-26	processing	year	and	the	2023	base	tax	year. Where	appropriate,	links	and	publications	associated	with	FSA9s	Partner	Connect	and	Knowledge	Center	have	been properly	updated.	We	also	removed	references	to	COVID-19	guidance	and	waivers.

Some	sections	were	moved	to	better	align	topics	and	assist	with	narrative	flow.	Use	the	search	feature	to	find	sections that	may	have	been	relocated.	The	following	describes	changes	made	in	each	chapter.

## Chapter	1:	The	Application	Process

- We	removed	the	&lt;Returning	FAFSA	Filers=	section	as	FAFSA	renewal	functionality	has	been	deferred	for	future	cycles.

## Chapter	2:	Filling	Out	the	FAFSA

- We	added	a	section	on	signatures	which	describes	the	appropriate	use	of	the	signature	page	from	the	FAFSA	Partner Portal	(FPP).
- We	expanded	the	&lt;Student	Tax	Filing	Status	(19)=	section	to	include	subsections	on	(1)	nontax	filers,	foreign countries,	and	international	organizations	and	(2)	fiscal	year	tax	returns.
- We	updated	the	tax	line	number	used	for	education	credits	to	IRS	Form	1040:	line	29	+	IRS	Form	1040	Schedule	3: line	3.
- We	moved	the	section	on	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	to	Chapter	5.
- We	expanded	&lt;Parent	Tax	Filing	Status	(37)=	section	to	explain	the	six	answer	options	on	the	FAFSA	form	and	when each	answer	should	be	selected.	This	section	also	explains	when	an	answer	to	this	question	might	be	conflicting information	that	requires	resolution	(comment	code	303).

## Chapter	3:	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility

- Edits	to	this	chapter	include	general	changes	and	updated	links,	but	no	significant	changes	or	reorganization.

## Chapter	4:	Verification,	Updates,	and	Corrections

- We	added	a	note	regarding	the	unavailability	of	the	Verification	of	Identity	functionality	in	the	FPP	and	the	flexibility the	Department	provided	around	reporting	timeframes.
- We	added	a	note	to	the	&lt;Using	the	Tax	Return=	section	regarding	the	treatment	negative	values	when	calculating Income	Earned	from	Work.
- We	renamed	the	&lt;Special	Cases=	section	to	&lt;Unique	Situations	and	Exceptions=	and	moved	&lt;Verification	for	Confined or	Incarcerated	Individuals=	to	a	subsection	under	this	renamed	section.
- Under	&lt;Filers	of	Amended	Returns=,	we	removed	the	exception	to	not	update	tax	information	for	certain	amended tax	return	filers.	This	exception	was	outlined	in	Electronic	Announcement	GEN-24-29	and	was	limited	to	the	2024-25 application	cycle.
- We	updated	acceptable	documentation	guidance	for	individuals	who	are	victims	of	tax-related	identity	theft.
- We	added	subsection	&lt;Birth	of	a	Child=	under	the	&lt;Updating	Information=	section.

## Chapter	5:	Special	Cases

- We	moved	the	section	on	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	from	Chapter	2.

## Chapter	1

## The	Application	Process:	FAFSA	to	ISIR

The	laws	governing	the	Federal	Student	Aid	(FSA)	programs	require	that	a	person	apply	for	aid	with	a	form	provided	by the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	(ED,	Department)	and	that	no	fee	be	charged	for	processing	it.	This	form	is	the	Free Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA ® )	form.

To	be	considered	for	federal	student	aid,	a	student	must	complete	a	FAFSA	form.	It	collects	financial	and	other	information used	to	calculate	the	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI;	formerly	Expected	Family	Contribution	or	EFC)	and	to	determine	a	student9s eligibility	through	computer	matches	with	other	agencies.

The	FAFSA	form	is	the	only	application	students	must	complete	to	apply	for	Title	IV	aid.	A	school	cannot	require	extra information	from	students	to	package	Title	IV	aid,	except	for	verification,	resolution	of	conflicting	information,	or professional	judgment	determinations.	However,	a	school	may	require	additional	information	for	other	purposes,	such	as packaging	private	or	institutional	aid.	If	the	school	collects	additional	information	that	affects	Title	IV	eligibility,	it	must take	the	information	into	account	when	awarding	Title	IV	aid.

## Types	of	FAFSA	Applications

More	than	99%	of	FAFSA	forms	are	filed	electronically.	However,	there	are	other	options	for	individuals	unwilling	or	unable to	file	electronically.

## FAFSA	Online

Implementation	of	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	and	the	FUTURE	Act	required	a	complete	overhaul	of	the	FAFSA	form, beginning	with	the	2024-25	award	year.	Submitted	FAFSA	forms	are	sent	directly	to	the	FAFSA	Processing	System	(FPS). Help	is	available	for	students	online	or	by	calling	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Information	Center	(FSAIC)	at	1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243).

There	are	many	advantages	to	filing	electronically,	including:

- Faster	processing;
- Availability	of	online	help;
- Skip	logic,	which	allows	applicants	to	skip	over	questions	that	don9t	pertain	to	them;	and
- Fewer	errors	and	rejected	applications	because	internal	and	end-of-entry	data	edits	ensure	that	required	fields	are completed	and	conflicts	are	resolved	prior	to	submission.

## Paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	Form

The	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	is	available	on	StudentAid.gov.	In	future	cycles,	students	will	also	be	able	to	call	the	Federal Student	Aid	Information	Center	(FSAIC)	at	1-800-433-3243	to	request	a	single	copy.

The	form	can	be	printed	and	completed	by	hand,	or	by	typing	the	data	on	the	PDF	before	printing	and	mailing	it.	The mailing	address	is	printed	on	the	first	page	of	the	FAFSA	form	under	&lt;Mail	Your	FAFSA®	Form=.	The	address	changes annually,	so	use	the	address	printed	on	the	associated	year9s	FAFSA	form.

You	must	mail all fillable	pages	of	the	form	(pages	7-20),	including	pages	that	are	left	blank	because	they	do	not	apply	to the	applicant.	Extra	postage	will	be	required	due	to	the	size	and/or	weight	of	the	mailing.

FSA	no	longer	prints	or	mails	aid-related	publications,	though	they	are	available	on	StudentAid.gov	for	users	to	download and	print.

## Incarcerated	Applicants

Incarcerated	applicants	who	have	access	to	the	necessary	technology	can	complete	a	FAFSA	form	online	using	their StudentAid.gov	account	username	and	password.	However,	many	incarcerated	applicants	will	not	be	able	to	file electronically	due	to	limitations	on	access	to	computers	and	the	internet.	These	applicants	can	complete	a	paper	(PDF) FAFSA	form	designated	specifically	for	incarcerated	applicants,	available	on	the	Prison	Education	Programs	resource	page of	the	FSA	Knowledge	Center.

The	mailing	address	for	the	Incarcerated	Applicant	FAFSA	form	is	printed	on	the	first	page	of	the	form	under	&lt;Mail	Your FAFSA®	Form=.	The	address	changes	annually	and	differs	from	the	general	FAFSA	form	mailing	address,	so	use	the address	printed	on	the	associated	year9s	Incarcerated	Applicant	FAFSA	form.	You	must	mail all fillable	pages	of	the	form (pages	7-20),	including	pages	that	are	left	blank	because	they	do	not	apply	to	the	applicant.	Extra	postage	will	be required	due	to	the	size	and/or	weight	of	the	mailing.

## FAFSA	Partner	Portal

The	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(FPP)	replaced	FAA	Access	to	CPS	Online	beginning	with	the	2024-25	award	year.	FSA decommissioned	the	FAA	Access	site	after	the	2023324	application	cycle	closed.

The	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	removed	the	ability	for	a	financial	aid	administrator	(FAA)	to	initiate	a	new	application	on	behalf of	a	student.	This	is	due	to	the	requirement	in	the	FUTURE	Act	that	all	FAFSA	form	contributors	(including	students, spouses,	and	parents)	must	provide	their	consent	to	disclose	information	to	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	(IRS)	and approval	to	retrieve	and	use	certain	Federal	Tax	Information	(FTI).	FAAs	cannot	provide	consent	and	approval	on	behalf	of any	other	person.	Therefore,	you	will	not	be	able	to	use	the	FPP	to	start	and	submit	a	new	FAFSA	form	on	an	applicant9s behalf.	However,	you	can	make	certain	corrections	or	updates.

Note: There	will	be	two	active	portals	that	coincide	with	the	two	open	FAFSA	application	cycles.	The	links	below are	specific	to	the	application	cycle. Be	sure	to	use	the	correct	portal	for	the	applicable	award	year.

- 2024-25	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	-	https://fafsa.partnerportal.ed.gov
- 2025-26	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	-	https://fafsa.partnerportal-2526.ed.gov

If	the	Department	is	able	to	consolidate	to	one	portal	in	future	cycles,	we	will	provide	an	updated	link.

## Translation	Assistance

The	FAFSA	form	is	available	in	English	and	Spanish.	If	you	need	assistance	completing	the	form	in	English	or	Spanish contact	the	FSAIC	at	1-800-433-3243.	Translation	assistance	in	additional	languages	is	available	by	calling	1-833-6102590	and	pressing	&lt;7=	to	request	a	specific	language.

## Account	Username	and	Password	(FSA	ID)

The	account	username	and	password,	also	known	as	the	FSA	ID,	is	used	to	access	a	person9s	StudentAid.gov	account.	It serves	as	an	electronic	signature	and	a	digital	identifier	to	allow	access	to	various	ED	systems	and	services	for	students, spouses	of	students,	parents,	or	spouses/partners	of	parents.	Therefore,	each	individual	must	create	their	own	account and	should	not	share	their	login	credentials	with	anyone,	including	FAAs.	Users	can	create	an	account	online	at StudentAid.gov	quickly	and	securely.	See	Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-23-123	for	additional	information	on creating	a	StudentAid.gov	account	for	individuals	without	a	Social	Security	number.

Each	person	who	provides	data	in	the	online	FAFSA	form must have	an	account	username	and	password	to	access	the form.	In	the	past,	a	Social	Security	number	(SSN)	was	required	to	create	a	StudentAid.gov	account.	Starting	with	the 2024325	award	year,	all	individuals4even	those	without	an	SSN4can	create	a	StudentAid.gov	account.	Persons	with	an SSN	will	still	have	their	information	verified	by	the	Social	Security	Administration	(SSA),	while	those	without	an	SSN	will use	the	TransUnion®	knowledge-based	identity	verification	process	described	below.

The	account	username	and	password	are	created	in	real-time	so	that	the	student	or	other	contributor	can	use	it immediately	to	enter	the	FAFSA	form.	Pending	StudentAid.gov	accounts	with	an	SSN	will	be	sent	to	the	SSA	to	be matched.	Only	those	accounts	with	a	successful	match	(&lt;SSA	Match	Status=	value	of	4	on	the	Institutional	Student

Information	Record)	will	be	considered	verified.	A	pending	username	and	password	that	has	not	been	verified	will	still allow	the	user	to	access	and	submit	the	online	FAFSA	form	and	complete	other	limited	actions	on	StudentAid.gov. However,	the	Department	will	not	be	able	to	retrieve	federal	tax	data	from	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	(IRS).	For	this reason,	we	recommend	that	users	do	not	sign	and	submit	the	online	FAFSA	form	until	the	account	username	and password	is	verified	through	a	match	with	the	SSA.

If	the	SSN	match	is	unsuccessful,	the	account	is	not	considered	verified,	and	an	email	is	sent	to	notify	the	individual	that they	should	review	the	information	they	provided	(name,	date	of	birth,	and	SSN)	to	ensure	it	is	accurate.	If	the	applicant used	an	unverified	account	username	and	password	to	sign	their	FAFSA	form,	the	applicant	is	also	sent	a	paper	FAFSA Submission	Summary	requesting	all	required	signatures.

## TransUnion ® 	Knowledge-Based	Identity	Verification

Users	who	create	a	StudentAid.gov	account	without	an	SSN	will	be	required	to	complete	a	knowledge-based	identity verification	process	with	TransUnion®	to	verify	their	identity	and	provide	login	credentials.	The	student	(if	a	citizen	of	one of	the	Freely	Associated	States	-	the	Republic	of	the	Marshall	Islands,	the	Republic	of	Palau,	or	the	Federated	States	of Micronesia),	student9s	spouse,	parent,	or	parent	spouse/partner	are	sent	through	the	TransUnion®	process	when	they	do not	have	an	SSN	and	check	the	&lt;I	don9t	have	an	SSN=	box	during	the	account	creation	process.	They	will	be	asked	to provide	additional	information	to	confirm	their	identity.

## FAFSA	Filers	Under	the	Age	of	13

Because	the	Children9s	Online	Privacy	Protection	Act	(COPPA)	of	1998	prohibits	any	entity,	including	a	government agency,	from	electronically	conducting	business	or	communicating	with	a	person	under	age	13,	applicants	who	are	12	or younger	cannot	complete	the	FAFSA	form	online.	Instead,	when	they	apply	for	financial	aid,	the	student	and	required contributor(s)	can	fill	out	the	appropriate	award	year	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	and	mail	it	to:

Federal	Student	Aid	Programs Attn:	COPPA	Process 25	Air	Park	Drive London,	KY	40744-8236

Such	applicants	should	not	provide	an	email	address	on	the	application	or	any	correction	that	might	follow.	After	the FAFSA	form	is	submitted,	it	will	be	processed	and	a	paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	will	be	sent	to	the	student	and	an ISIR	will	be	sent	to	schools.	See	Electronic	Announcement	APP-24-02	for	additional	information.

## Processing	the	FAFSA

Applications	that	are	signed	and	submitted	online	go	directly	to	the	FPS.	The	paper	FAFSA	forms	go	to	the	FAFSA processor	for	data	entry	and	then	to	the	FPS.	The	FPS	uses	application	data	to	calculate	the	SAI	and	to	match	the student9s	information	against	several	databases:	NSLDS,	the	SSA,	and	the	Department	of	Veterans	Affairs,	as	well	as	the Department	of	Homeland	Security9s	database	of	noncitizens.

The	FPS	also	checks	the	application	for	possible	inconsistencies	and	mistakes.	For	instance,	if	a	dependent	student reported	the	parents9	marital	status	as	married	but	reported	the	family	size	as	&lt;2,=	the	edit	checks	would	catch	the inconsistency.	Even	when	data	is	inconsistent,	the	FPS	may	be	able	to	calculate	an	SAI	based	on	assumptions.	Students who	submit	applications	online	will	be	able	to	correct	or	confirm	FPS	edits	before	submitting	the	application.

## Output	Documents

After	processing	is	complete,	the	FPS	produces	output	documents	3	the	Institutional	Student	Information	Record	(ISIR)	and the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	3	that	show	the	information	the	student	originally	provided,	the	SAI,	results	of	the eligibility	matches,	information	about	aid	history,	and	information	about	any	inconsistencies	identified	through	the	FPS edits.	If	the	FPS	was	unable	to	calculate	an	SAI,	the	output	record	will	not	show	one.	The	ISIR	is	made	available electronically	to	the	schools	the	student	listed	on	the	FAFSA	form	(or	added	later)	and	their	state	agency.	The	FAFSA Submission	Summary	is	made	available	to	the	student	online	or	a	paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	is	mailed	to	the student	if	the	student	is	unable	to	access	it	online.	The	type	of	output	document	depends	on	the	type	of	record	that	the applicant	submitted.	Neither	the	online	nor	the	paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	will	contain	FTI.	See	Volume	6	of	the 2025-26	FAFSA	Specifications	Guide	for	additional	information.

You	will	receive	an	ISIR	for	the	student	only	if	the	applicant	includes	your	school	on	their	FAFSA	form.	If	your	school	is	not listed,	you	can	request	an	ISIR	for	the	student	through	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	by	adding	your	federal	school	code	if	you have	the	applicant9s	Data	Release	Number	(DRN),	which	authorizes	your	access	to	the	student9s	application	information. The	DRN	appears	on	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary,	on	the	FAFSA	confirmation	page,	and	in	the	FAFSA	confirmation email.

You	are	required	to	receive	ISIRs	and	to	accept	FAFSA	Submission	Summaries	from	students,	but	you	cannot	require students	to	submit	FAFSA	Submission	Summaries	to	receive	aid.	If	you	don9t	have	an	ISIR	for	a	student,	your	federal school	code	must	be	added	to	their	record	so	that	an	ISIR	is	sent	to	you.	We	recommend	making	corrections	electronically via	the	online	FAFSA	(the	student)	or	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(the	school);	however,	students	can	also	use	a	paper	FAFSA Submission	Summary	to	make	corrections.	If	you	don9t	have	an	ISIR	for	a	student	who	provided	a	FAFSA	Submission Summary,	you	must	use	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	to	package	and	disburse	the	student	aid.	Again,	you	must	also ensure	that	your	school	code	is	added	to	the	student9s	FPS	record	(see	the	&lt;How	to	Submit	Corrections	and	Updates= section	in	Chapter	4).

The	FAFSA	Submission	Summaries	and	ISIRs	include	comment	codes	and	text	explaining	any	questionable	results	from FAFSA	processing.	Some	comment	codes	also	have	an	associated	C	Flag,	which	you	must	resolve	before	paying	the student	aid.	If	a	student9s	FAFSA	Submission	Summary/ISIR	contains	a	comment	code	that	requires	resolution,	the underlying	issue	must	be	resolved	before	any	Title	IV	funds	may	be	disbursed	to	the	student.	For	instance,	if	an	applicant has	defaulted	on	a	federal	student	loan,	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and	ISIR	will	note	this	in	several	places, including	comments	to	the	applicant	and	the	NSLDS	financial	aid	history	page.	In	addition,	if	a	school	disburses	Title	IV funds	to	a	student	with	a	comment	code	that	requires	resolution	and	the	student	withdraws	before	the	school	has resolved	the	underlying	issue,	any	funds	disbursed	must	be	returned	to	ED	since	the	funds	were	provided	to	an	otherwise ineligible	student.

For	other	problems,	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and	ISIR	will	show	that	the	FAFSA	form	has	been	rejected	and	no	SAI has	been	calculated.	The	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	will	tell	the	applicant	how	to	resolve	the	reject	by	correcting	errors or	providing	consent	and	approval,	signatures,	or	more	information.	A	complete	list	of	comments,	C	Flags,	reject	codes, and	required	resolutions	are	available	in	Volume	7	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA	Specifications	Guide.

A	valid	output	document	(ISIR	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary)	is	one	on	which	all	the	information	reported	on	a	student9s FAFSA	form	is	accurate	and	complete	as	of	the	date	the	application	is	signed.

## Valid	Output	Document

## Deadlines

The	application	processing	cycle	typically	lasts	21	months,	with	the	FAFSA	form	opening	on	October	1	in	the	year	prior	to the	start	of	the	award	year.	For	the	2025-26	application	cycle,	the	online	FAFSA	opened	for	beta	testing	to	a	limited population	of	applicants	on	October	1,	with	the	form	expected	to	be	available	to	all	applicants	by	December	1,	2024. Applications	will	be	accepted	through	June	30,	2026.

The	FPS	must	receive	a	student9s	online	FAFSA	information	by	June	30,	2026.	A	paper	FAFSA	form	must	be	legible,	and	it must	be	mailed	to	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Programs	address	listed	on	the	FAFSA	form	in	time	for	the	processor	to	receive it	by	June	30,	2026.	There	are	no	exceptions	to	these	deadlines.	An	online	application	received	after	June	30,	2026,	will not	be	processed.

A	paper	application	received	before	the	application	opens	for	the	award	year,	or	after	June	30,	2026,	will	be	returned unprocessed	with	a	letter	of	explanation.	If	it	is	signed	before	and	received	after	the	application	opens	for	the	award	year, it	will	be	accepted	but	the	student	will	receive	a	rejected	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	asking	them	to	date	and	re-sign	the FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and	return	it	for	processing.

For	other	deadlines	pertaining	to	corrections,	changes,	disbursements,	and	verification,	see	the	official	deadline	notice	for the	2025-26	award	year.	It	will	provide	all	the	processing	deadline	dates	and	will	be	available	in	the	Knowledge	Center under	&lt;Federal	Registers.=	For	these	deadlines,	the	date	the	FPS	processed	the	ISIR	transaction	is	the	date	the	institution received	the	ISIR.	The	processed	date	is	displayed	above	the	SAI	on	the	first	page	of	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and ISIR	printout.

Students	who	submit	the	FAFSA	form	later	in	the	award	year	can	receive	aid	for	the	entire	year,	including	completed payment	periods,	if	they	were	not	ineligible	at	the	time.	See	the	section	on	retroactive	disbursements	for	completed periods	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

## Chapter	2

## Filling	Out	the	FAFSA	Form

This	chapter	describes	the	2025-26	FAFSA	form.	While	the	chapter	follows	the	organization	of	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form and	the	ISIR,	the	guidance	applies	equally	to	the	online	FAFSA.	To	see	how	FAFSA	data	are	used	to	calculate	the	Student Aid	Index	(SAI),	refer	to	Chapter	3.

The	easiest,	fastest,	and	most	accurate	way	to	complete	a	FAFSA	form	is	using	the	online	application	and	providing consent	and	approval	for	the	access,	disclosure,	and	use	of	federal	tax	information	(FTI).	The	online	FAFSA	form	provides robust	instructions	for	completing	the	form.	It	also	provides	a	clear	path	for	the	student	and	each	contributor,	allowing them	to	skip	(or	never	see)	questions	that	are	unnecessary,	irrelevant,	or	already	known	based	on	information	previously provided	or	imported.	However,	some	applicants	will	be	unable	or	unwilling	to	complete	the	FAFSA	form	online	and	have the	option	to	complete	a	paper	version	of	the	form.

## FUTURE	Act	Direct	Data	Exchange	(FA-DDX)

The	FUTURE	Act	amended	Section	6103	of	the	Internal	Revenue	Code	(IRC)	to	allow	the	Internal	Revenue	Service	(IRS)	to disclose	certain	FTI	to	FSA.	The	IRS	and	FSA	worked	together	to	develop	the	FUTURE	Act	Direct	Data	Exchange	(FA-DDX) which	established	a	secure	connection	between	both	agencies	through	an	application	programming	interface	that processes	requests	in	near-real	time.	The	FA-DDX	replaced	the	IRS	Data	Retrieval	Tool	(IRS-DRT)	to	import	certain	FTI	into an	applicant9s	FAFSA	form.

## Consent	and	Approval

The	student	and	each	contributor	to	the	FAFSA	form	must	provide	consent	and	approval	to	the	access,	disclosure,	and	use of	FTI	in	evaluating	the	applicant9s	eligibility	for	Title	IV	aid.	Consent	and	approval	are	required	regardless	of	the application	method	(online	or	paper).

## Definitions

FAFSA	Privacy	Act	Consent 3	Formal	consent	provided	by	an	applicant	and	any	applicable	contributor(s)	for	a given	FAFSA	cycle	(e.g.,	December	2024	to	September	2026	for	the	2025-26	FAFSA	form)	that	meets	the statutory	requirements	of	collecting	and	using	an	individual9s	personally-identifiable	information	(PII)	under	the Privacy	Act,	as	amended	(5	U.S.C.	§	552a).	PII	provided	on	the	FAFSA	form	(e.g.,	name,	date	of	birth,	Social Security	number)	with	consent	of	the	individual,	will	be	provided	to	the	IRS	to	conduct	a	match	for	the Department	to	receive	FTI	for	purposes	of	determining	an	applicant9s	federal	financial	aid	eligibility	and	permit further	redisclosure	of	FTI	by	the	Department.

FAFSA	FTI	Approval 3	Formal	approval	granted	by	an	applicant	and	any	applicable	contributors	for	a	given FAFSA	cycle	(e.g.,	December	2024	to	September	2026	for	the	2025-26	FAFSA	form)	to	retrieve	and	use	FTI	to determine	an	applicant9s	federal	financial	aid	eligibility	as	well	as	permit	the	redisclosure	of	FTI	by	the Department	to	an	eligible	institution;	state	higher	education	agency;	or	a	designated	scholarship	organization	for the	application,	award,	and	administration	of	student	aid	programs.	An	applicant	and	contributor	(if	applicable) must	provide	approval	once	each	year.	If	FAFSA	FTI	approval	is	not	provided,	the	student	will	not	be	eligible	for any	Title	IV	aid	until	the	approval	is	provided	by	each	contributor.

To	provide	consent	and	approval,	FAFSA	contributors	(including	parent(s)	or	spouse)	must	agree	to:

- 1.	 The	Department9s	use	and	disclosure	of	their	information	(e.g.,	name	and	Social	Security	number)	to	match	with	the IRS;
- 2.	 The	disclosure	of	their	FTI	by	the	IRS	to	the	Department;
- 3.	 The	use	of	their	FTI	by	a	Department	official	to	determine	an	applicant9s	eligibility	for	federal	student	aid	and	the amount	for	which	they	are	eligible;	and
- 4.	 The	redisclosure	of	FTI	by	the	Department	to	an	eligible	institution,	state	higher	education	agency,	or	a	designated scholarship	organization	(e.g.,	institutional	or	state	financial	aid).

Only	the	Department	has	the	authority	to	obtain	approval	and	consent	for	the	use	and	disclosure	of	FTI	for	such	purposes. Our	partners	(FAAs,	advocates,	etc.)	are	not	permitted	to	obtain	approval	and	consent	on	behalf	of	FAFSA	contributors (including	parent(s)	or	spouse)	for	the	use	and	disclosure	of	FTI.

Once	a	FAFSA	contributor	has	provided	consent	and	approval	for	use	and	disclosure	of	FTI	for	a	FAFSA	cycle	(e.g.,	the 2025-26	FAFSA	cycle),	they	cannot	revoke	consent	for	that	cycle.	The	ability	to	revoke	consent	is	not	needed	for	FAFSA purposes	because	the	FAFSA	contributor	is	providing	a	one-time	consent	for	a	specific	tax	year	and	an	annual	consent	is required	for	each	FAFSA	cycle.

Students	and	contributors	are	not	able	to	view	or	edit	the	imported	FTI	data.	This	is	to	enhance	security,	privacy,	and	to reduce	the	risk	of	the	misuse	of	sensitive	data.	However,	you	(the	financial	aid	administrator)	will	be	able	to	see	the transferred	data	on	the	ISIR.	Schools	and	other	partners	that	receive	ISIRs	must	protect	federal	student	aid	information provided	to	them	by	the	Department	or	otherwise	obtained	in	support	of	the	application,	award,	and	administration	of	the federal	student	aid	programs	as	permitted	under	the	IRC	6103(l)(13)	and	HEA,	as	amended.	In	keeping	with	the expectation	that	you	protect	the	confidentiality	of	data	associated	with	the	Title	IV	programs,	you	must	not	disclose	FTI from	the	FAFSA	form	unless	the	disclosure	and	use	is	permitted	under	the	IRC	6103(l)(13)	and	HEA	1098h.	For	additional information	and	guidance	on	the	use	of	FTI,	see	Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-23-34.

## Signatures

Each	student	and	required	contributor	must	both	(1)	provide	consent	and	approval	to	obtain	tax	information	from	the	IRS and	(2)	sign	the	FAFSA	application.	While	both	the	student	and	contributors	must	provide	consent	and	approval	once	per application	cycle,	a	signature	may	be	required	multiple	times	throughout	the	cycle	if	a	student	makes	corrections	to	a processed	FAFSA	form.	In	these	cases,	the	student	or	the	contributor	must	sign	that	correction	to	certify	the	information	is accurate	but	will	not	be	prompted	to	provide	consent	and	approval	again.	Therefore,	it	is	possible	for	a	FAFSA	transaction to	contain	consent	and	approval	but	not	the	required	signature(s).	If	your	school	receives	an	ISIR	transaction	indicating that	the	transaction	source	(i.e.	paper	or	online	FAFSA)	was	unsigned,	the	applicant	or	contributor	can	return	to	their FAFSA	form	and	sign	the	correction.	Alternatively,	you	can	print	a	signature	page	in	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(FPP),	collect the	necessary	original	signature(s),	and	indicate	in	FPP	that	you	have	the	signature	on	file.	This	will	resolve	the	signature requirement	but	will	not	satisfy	the	requirement	for	consent	and	approval.	Only	the	Department	can	collect	a	contributor9s consent	and	approval.

## Federal	Tax	Information

The	following	data	received	by	the	Department	from	the	IRS	are	considered	FTI:

- Tax	Year	(ex.	Award	year	2025-26	is	based	on	2023	tax	year	information	from	the	IRS)
- Tax	Filing	Status
- Adjusted	Gross	Income	(AGI)
- Number	of	Exemptions	and	Number	of	Dependents
- Income	Earned	from	Work
- Taxes	Paid
- Educational	Credits
- Untaxed	IRA	distributions
- IRA	deductions	and	payments
- Tax	exempt	interest
- Untaxed	pension	amounts
- Schedule	C	net	profit/loss
- Indicators	for	Schedules	A,	B,	D,	E,	F,	H
- IRS	response	code

In	some	limited	circumstances,	the	student	or	contributor	may	need	to	manually	provide	data	if	it	is	unavailable	through the	FA-DDX	or	does	not	reflect	their	current	personal	circumstances.	In	these	cases,	manually	entered	data	will	be	used	in the	SAI	calculation.	For	example,	a	contributor	would	be	required	to	manually	report	income	and	tax	data	if	they	were married	and	filed	their	2023	U.S.	tax	return	jointly	with	their	spouse	but	are	now	divorced.

## IRS	Response	Codes

The	IRS	will	provide	one	of	the	following	response	codes	for	each	contributor,	and	they	will	appear	on	a	student9s	ISIR.

| Code        | Indication                             |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| 200         | Usable FTI data retrieved successfully |
| 214         | No return on file                      |
| 203 206 212 | No usable FTI data retrieved           |

The	IRS	provides	a	response	code	value	of	&lt;200=	when	the	IRS	has	data	and	it	was	successfully	shared	with	FSA	for inclusion	on	the	applicant9s	FAFSA	form.	Income	and	tax	information	for	contributors	with	a	&lt;200=	IRS	response	code	is considered	verified.	The	IRS	response	code	of	&lt;214=	means	the	IRS	was	able	to	locate	the	individual	in	its	records	and confirmed	that	it	does	not	have	a	tax	return	on	file	for	that	individual	for	the	tax	year,	designating	them	as	a	non-U.S.	tax filer.

IRS	response	codes	&lt;203=,	&lt;206=,	and	&lt;212=	indicate	that	the	IRS	is	unable	to	provide	FTI	for	that	contributor.	This	may	be because	the	IRS	is	unable	to	locate	the	individual	in	its	records	or	the	IRS	is	unable	to	share	FTI	(such	as	in	cases	of identity	theft).	If	the	IRS	returns	any	of	these	codes	for	a	contributor,	that	individual	must	manually	provide	income	and tax	information	on	the	applicant9s	FAFSA	form.	This	manually	entered	data	will	be	used	in	the	SAI	calculation	but	is not considered	verified	and	may	be	subject	to	verification	if	selected	by	the	Department	or	your	institution.

## Contributors

&lt;Contributor=	refers	to	anyone	who	is	required	to	provide	information,	consent,	and	approval,	and	a	signature	on	the FAFSA	form.	The	FAFSA	form	is	organized	by	contributor.	Each	contributor	will	complete	their	own	section	of	the	form which	contains	specific	questions	and	instructions	pertaining	to	that	contributor.	The	guidance	in	this	chapter supplements	those	instructions	and	explains	why	some	of	the	questions	are	needed	on	the	FAFSA	form.

The	following	sections	discuss	the	questions	found	within	each	contributor	section	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	parents mentioned	are	the	legal	parents	of	dependent	students.	The	numbers	in	parentheses	are	for	the	items	as	they	appear	on the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary,	ISIR,	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA,	and	FAFSA	Partner	Portal.	The	FAFSA	form	is	considered	a &lt;snapshot=	of	the	family9s	information	as	of	the	date	the	application	is	signed	and	it	can	be	updated	only	in	certain circumstances	and	only	for	certain	items.	See	Chapter	4	for	more	information	about	updating	a	FAFSA	form.

## Contributor:	Student

This	section	consists	of	24	questions	related	to	the	student.

## Student	Identity	Information	(1)

This	question	requests	the	name,	date	of	birth,	and	Social	Security	number	(SSN)	or	Individual	Taxpayer	Identification Number	(ITIN)	of	the	student	contributor.	The	name,	with	other	identifying	information,	is	used	for	several	data	matches.

Because	the	Department	matches	the	student9s	name	and	SSN	with	the	Social	Security	Administration	(SSA),	the	name	on the	FAFSA	form	should	match	the	one	in	the	SSA9s	records	(i.e.,	as	it	appears	on	the	student9s	Social	Security	card).

Students	(except	citizens	of	one	of	the	Freely	Associated	States	3	see	&lt;Account	Username	and	Password=	in	Chapter	1) must	have	an	SSN	to	apply	for	federal	student	aid.	If	they	submit	a	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	without	an	SSN,	the	FAFSA form	will	be	returned	unprocessed.	Students	will	be	unable	to	submit	a	FAFSA	form	electronically	without	an	account username	and	password,	which	requires	an	SSN	(except	students	who	are	citizens	one	of	the	Freely	Associated	States). The	student	must	contact	the	local	SSA	office	to	get	an	SSN	or	to	find	out	what	the	number	is	if	they	lost	their	Social Security	card.	Go	to	https://www.ssa.gov/number-card	for	more	information.

If	the	student9s	name,	date	of	birth,	or	SSN	does	not	match	with	the	Social	Security	Administration,	the	student	typically needs	to	resolve	the	issue	with	the	SSA.	If	the	information	submitted	is	correct,	the	student	must	contact	SSA	to	update its	records.	After	the	student	receives	confirmation	that	SSA	has	corrected	its	records,	the	student	must	contact	the Federal	Student	Aid	Information	Center	(FSAIC)	and	ask	them	to	manually	sync	their	data	with	SSA.	Alternatively,	if	the student	notifies	the	school	that	they	received	confirmation	from	SSA,	the	FAA	may	update	the	Resend	to	Matches	field	to &lt;Y=	in	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	and	submit	it	as	a	correction	so	the	transaction	can	go	back	to	SSA	for	an	updated	match flag.	Records	sent	for	rematching	will	continue	to	receive	this	match	flag	until	SSA	updates	its	database.

Students	who	enter	their	name,	date	of	birth,	or	SSN	incorrectly	should	log	in	to	StudentAid.gov	and	update	their information	in Account	Settings .	The	record	will	be	resent	to	SSA	for	matching.	Once	SSA	verifies	the	account,	the student	should	update	their	FAFSA	form	by	submitting	a	correction.

## Student	Contact	Information	(2)

This	is	the	student9s	current	mobile	phone,	email	address,	and	permanent	home	address,	with	three	exceptions:

- Students	under	the	age	of	13	should	not	provide	an	email	address	as	FSA	cannot	communicate	with	them electronically.	See	&lt;FAFSA	Filers	Under	the	Age	of	13=	in	Chapter	1	for	additional	information.
- Incarcerated	students	should	use	an	address	where	they	can	reliably	receive	mail.	This	may	be	the	physical	address of	the	facility	they	are	in,	the	address	of	the	school	(if	permitted	by	the	school),	or	a	central	processing	facility	used by	the	facility	for	mail	distribution.	If	a	prison	ID	number	is	required	by	the	facility	for	the	applicant	to	receive	mail, the	applicant	should	list	that	at	the	end	of	the	address	field.	If	an	incarcerated	student	is	released,	they	should	also update	their	address	in	their	StudentAid.gov	account	or	on	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.
- Homeless	students	should	use	a	mailing	address	where	they	can	reliably	receive	mail.	That	can	be	the	address	of	a relative	or	friend	who	has	given	them	permission	to	use	it,	or	it	can	be	their	school9s	address	if	they	have	contacted the	school	for	permission	and	instructions	on	how	mail	they	receive	at	the	school	will	reach	them.	As	soon	as homeless	students	have	more	permanent	housing,	they	should	update	their	address	in	their	StudentAid.gov	account or	on	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.

If	the	student	provides	an	email	address,	they	should	get	an	email	with	a	link	to	their	online	FAFSA	Submission	Summary within	one	to	three	days	after	the	FPS	receives	the	completed	application.	The	Department	will	also	use	this	email	address to	correspond	with	the	student	regarding	their	application.

## Student	Current	Marital	Status	(3)

This	is	marital	status	&lt;as	of	today=	3	the	day	the	application	is	signed.	Marital	status	cannot	be	projected.	It	can	be updated	in	limited	circumstances;	see	Chapter	4.

A	student	who	is	only	engaged	should	select	&lt;single	(never	married)=	unless	they	wait	until	after	their	marriage	date	to complete	the	FAFSA	form.	A	student	in	a	relationship	that	meets	the	criteria	for	common-law	marriage	in	their	state	of legal	residence	should	select	&lt;married=	and	will	be	considered	independent.	A	student	who	is	separated	from	their	spouse should	select	&lt;separated=	and	will	be	considered	a	dependent	student	for	FAFSA	purposes,	unless	they	meet	other	criteria to	be	considered	an	independent	student.

## Student	College	or	Career	School	Plans	(4)

Students	should	answer	this	question	based	on	the	degree	or	certificate	program	they	will	be	working	on	at	the	start	of the	2025-26	award	year.	Students	may	update	the	answer	to	this	question	if	their	plans	change	or	they	progress	to	a higher	grade	level	during	the	award	year.

A	student9s	grade	level	is	not	based	on	the	number	of	years	the	student	has	attended	college	but	on	work	completed toward	the	degree	or	certificate.	For	instance,	a	full-time	student	might	attain	second-year	grade	level	after	one	year	of study,	while	a	half-time	student	would	take	two	years	to	reach	that	level.

The	student	should	also	indicate	whether	they	will	have	a	first	bachelor9s	degree	before	beginning	the	2025-26	year because	eligibility	for	Pell	and	Federal	Supplemental	Educational	Opportunity	grants	(FSEOG)	is	almost	exclusively restricted	to	students	who	have	not	received	a	bachelor9s	degree	or	completed	the	requirements	for	one.	See	&lt;General Eligibility	Requirements	for	Federal	Pell	Grants=	in	Volume	7,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook	regarding	degrees	from unaccredited	and	foreign	schools,	which	can	count	as	bachelor9s	degrees	for	Pell	and	FSEOG	eligibility.

If	the	student	indicates	they	have	a	first	bachelor9s	degree,	they	should	also	indicate	if	they	will	be	pursuing	an	initial teaching	certification	at	the	elementary	or	secondary	level.	If	a	student	answers	&lt;yes=	to	this	question,	you	must	evaluate and	determine	if	the	student	is	enrolled	in	a	postbaccalaureate	program	for	which	a	student	may	receive	a	Pell	Grant.	See Volume	7,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook	regarding	eligible	postbaccalaureate	programs.

A	student	who	is	a	graduate	or	professional	student	is	independent	for	purposes	of	Title	IV	aid	and	not	eligible	for	Pell grants	or	other	forms	of	undergraduate	aid.	If	a	Pell-eligible	student	incorrectly	indicates	they	are	working	on	a	master9s, doctorate,	or	graduate	certificate	program,	they	must	submit	a	correction	before	they	can	receive	a	Pell	grant.	If	a	student completes	an	undergraduate	program	during	the	year	and	begins	graduate	school,	the	student	can	update	the	answer	to this	question	and	the	FPS	will	reprocess	the	student9s	application.

See	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	definitions	of	undergraduate	and	graduate	students.

## Undergraduate	student	definition

34	CFR	668.2(b)	&lt;Undergraduate	student=

## Graduate	student	definition

34	CFR	668.2(b)	&lt;Graduate	or	professional	student=

## Student	Personal	(5),	Homelessness	(6),	or	Unusual	(7)	Circumstances

The	law	governing	the	Title	IV	programs	is	based	on	the	premise	that	the	family	is	the	first	source	of	the	student9s support,	and	the	law	provides	several	criteria	that	decide	if	the	student	is	considered	independent	of	their	parents	for	aid eligibility.	Note	that	a	student	reaching	the	age	of	18	or	21	or	living	apart	from	their	parents	does	not	on	its	own	affect their	dependency	status.

Questions	5	and	6,	along	with	information	from	other	FAFSA	questions,	are	used	to	determine	if	a	student	meets	eligibility criteria	to	be	considered	independent	and	not	required	to	submit	information	about	their	parents.	If	a	student	is considered	a	dependent	of	their	parents,	the	parents'	must	include	their	financial	information	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	FPS will	calculate	a	parent	contribution	and	add	it	to	the	student9s	contribution	to	derive	an	SAI.

For	the	2025-26	year,	a	student	who	meets	one	or	more	of	the	following	criteria	is	independent:

From Question	1:

- The	student	was	born	before	January	1,	2002.

## From Question	3:

- The	student	is	married	(not	separated)	or	remarried	as	of	the	application	date.

## From Question	4:

- The	student	is	a	graduate	or	professional	student	during	the	award	year.

## From Question	5:

- The	student	is	currently	serving	on	active	duty	in	the	U.S.	armed	forces	for	purposes	other	than	training.
- The	student	is	a	veteran	of	the	U.S.	armed	forces.
- The	student	has	children	or	dependents	other	than	a	spouse	(see	note	below	for	an	explanation	of	why	an	individual may	not	be	asked	this	question,	even	if	they	appear	to	have	children	or	dependents	included	in	their	family	size).
- The	student	is	(or	was	at	any	time	after	reaching	the	age	of	13)	an	orphan,	ward	of	the	court,	or	in	foster	care.
- The	student	is	(or	was	when	the	student	reached	the	age	of	majority)	a	legally	emancipated	minor	or	in	a	legal guardianship	(with	someone	other	than	their	parent	or	stepparent),	as	determined	by	a	court	in	the	student9s	state	of legal	residence.

Note: The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	required	ED	to	limit	or	eliminate	unnecessary	questions	from	the	FAFSA	form. If	the	answer	to	a	question	is	not	necessary	to	determine	a	student9s	eligibility	for	federal	student	aid	or	if	the answer	is	available	or	derivable	from	answers	to	other	questions,	the	Department	is	not	permitted	to	require	the student	to	provide	an	answer.

For	example,	when	completing	the	FAFSA	form	online,	applicants	are	only	asked	if	they	have	children	or dependents	other	than	a	spouse	if	they	are	under	the	age	of	24.	A	student	aged	24	or	older	will	not	have	the opportunity	to	answer	this	question	as	they	are	independent	by	age,	making	this	question	unnecessary.	In	FPP, the	answer	to	this	question	will	be	&lt;Blank=;	on	the	student9s	ISIR,	the	answer	to	this	question	will	be	&lt;No=. Therefore,	you	should	not	assume	that	a	&lt;Blank=	or	&lt;No=	indicates	the	student	does	not	have	children	or	other dependents.	It	is	possible	for	an	applicant	to	have	a	&lt;No=	or	&lt;Blank=	response	to	this	question	and	report	a	family size	that	appears	to	include	dependents	other	than	a	spouse.	This	is	not,	on	its	own,	conflicting	information.

## From Question	6:

- The	student	was	at	any	time	on	or	after	July	1,	2024,	determined	to	be	unaccompanied	and	(1)	homeless	or	(2)	selfsupporting	and	at	risk	of	being	homeless	with	a	determination	from	one	of	the	entities	listed	on	the	FAFSA	form.

## Independent	Student	Determination

HEA	Sec.	480(d)

In	unusual	circumstances,	an	aid	administrator	can	determine	that	a	student	who	doesn9t	meet	any	of	the	criteria	listed above	should	still	be	treated	as	an	independent	student.	A	student	may	indicate	that	they	have	an	unusual	circumstance by	selecting	&lt;Yes=	to Question	7 on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	student	may	then	skip	the	parent	sections	of	the	form.	Students who	select	&lt;Yes=	to	this	question	will	be	given	provisional	independent	student	status	and	directed	to	provide documentation	to	their	financial	aid	office	for	determination.	(See	&lt;Unusual	Circumstances=	in	Chapter	5.)

Persons	on	active	duty	in	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	(the	Army,	Navy,	Air	Force,	Marines,	Space	Force,	or	Coast	Guard)	for purposes	other	than	training	are	independent.

## Veteran	of	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	aligns	the	definition	of	veteran	with	the	definition	used	by	the	U.S.	Department	of	Veterans Affairs	(VA)	to	determine	veterans9	benefits.	The	Act	cites	Title	38	of	the	U.S.	Code	for	the	definition	of	a	veteran. Generally,	a	veteran	is	an	individual	who:

- Served	on	active	duty	in	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	(the	Army,	Navy,	Air	Force,	Marines,	Space	Force,	or	Coast	Guard)	for other	than	training	and	who	was	discharged	or	released	under	a	condition	other	than	&lt;dishonorable=;	or
- Served	on	active	duty	for	training	or	inactive	duty	for	training	in	the	U.S.	Armed	Forces	and	was	disabled	from	injury incurred	or	aggravated	in	the	line	of	duty.

Members	of	the	National	Guard	or	Reserves	are	only	considered	veterans	if	they	were	called	up	to	active	federal	duty	by presidential	order	for	a	purpose	other	than	training.	It	does	not	matter	how	long	the	active	duty	lasted	or	if	the	student returned	to	reserve	status	afterward,	but,	as	with	the	other	qualifying	veterans,	the	student	must	have	had	a	character	of service	that	was	not	&lt;dishonorable.=

The	FAFSA	form	also	tells	students	to	answer	&lt;Yes=	to	the	question	about	veteran	status	if	they	aren9t	yet	a	veteran	but will	be	by	June	30,	2026.

Students	serving	in	ROTC	or	currently	attending	a	U.S.	military	academy	are	not	veterans.	Additionally,	students	who attended	a	U.S.	military	academy	or	military	academy	preparatory	school	but	were	discharged	prior	to	commission (commonly	known	as	&lt;early	exit	cadets=)	are	not	veterans.

## Veteran	Definition

## 38	USC	101:	Definitions

## 38	CFR	3.1(d)

If	a	student	indicates	they	are	a	veteran	in Question	5 ,	the	FPS	performs	a	match	with	VA	records	to	confirm	that	status. The	VA	sends	the	result	back,	which	appears	as	a	match	flag	in	the	FAA	Information	section	of	the	output	document.	For VA	Match	Flags	2,	3,	and	4	(listed	below),	a	comment	and	a	C	flag	will	appear	on	the	FAFA	Submission	Summary	only	if veteran	status	is	the	sole	reason	that	the	student	would	be	independent.	See	Volume	7	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA Specifications	Guide	for	additional	details.

- VA	Match	Flag	1:	Confirmed	3	There	won9t	be	any	comments	on	the	output	document	if	the	VA	confirms	that	the student	is	a	veteran.
- VA	Match	Flag	2:	Not	a	Qualifying	Veteran	3	A	student	will	receive	this	flag	if	the	VA	database	indicates	they	are	not	a veteran.
- VA	Match	Flag	3:	Not	found	by	VA	3	A	student	will	receive	this	flag	if	the	student	is	not	in	the	VA	database.
- VA	Match	Flag	4:	Active	Duty	3	If	the	student	is	currently	on	active	duty,	they	are	not	a	veteran	yet.	However,	if	their active	duty	will	end	by	June	30,	2026,	they	count	as	a	veteran	for	purposes	of	determining	dependency	status. Because	the	student	should	have	answered	&lt;Yes=	to	the	active-duty	question,	they	would	be	independent	by	that criterion	and	wouldn9t	have	to	resolve	this	situation.

A	student	who	receives	a	VA	Match	Flag	of	2	or	3	and	is	independent	for	reasons	other	than	being	a	veteran	can	receive aid	as	an	independent	student	without	resolving	the	problem	with	their	veteran	status,	although	the	student	should	have the	VA	correct	its	database	if	it	has	incorrect	information.	If	the	student	is	not	independent	for	reasons	other	than	being	a veteran,	the	student	must	either	resolve	the	problem	with	their	veteran	status	or	correct	their	FAFSA	form.

If	the	student	is	a	veteran,	they	should	correct	any	problem	with	the	VA	or	provide	documentation	showing	they	are	a veteran,	or	will	be	one	by	June	30,	2026.	Students	should	provide	the	financial	aid	office	at	their	school	a	copy	of	their DD214	(the	Certificate	of	Release	or	Discharge	from	active	duty,	with	&lt;Character	of	Service=	as	anything	but &lt;dishonorable=).	If	it	shows	that	the	student	is	a	veteran,	they	can	receive	aid	as	an	independent	student.	If	a	National Guard	member	or	a	reservist	who	served	on	active	duty	(for	other	than	training)	did	not	receive	a	DD214	but	can	obtain	a letter	from	a	superior	officer	that	documents	the	call-up	to	active	duty	and	that	classifies	the	character	of	service	as anything	but	&lt;dishonorable,=	the	student	will	be	considered	a	veteran	for	FSA	purposes.	If	the	VA	match	problem	is	due	to an	error	in	the	VA9s	database,	the	student	should	contact	the	VA	and	correct	the	error.	Once	the	error	is	corrected,	you may	request	to	resend	the	application	to	agency	matches	on	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal.	A	subsequent	transaction	will	then reprocess	the	match	with	the	VA.

If	the	student	is	not	a	veteran	and	will	not	be	one	by	June	30,	2026,	they	must	correct	their	answer	to Question	5 and invite	at	least	one	parent	to	contribute	to	their	FAFSA	form.

## Children	and	Legal	Dependents

Students	who	have	legal	dependents	are	independent.	Legal	dependents	include	children	or	other	people	(except	a spouse)	who	meet	all	the	following	criteria:

- They	live	with	the	student	(or,	in	the	case	of	children,	live	apart	from	the	student	due	to	a	qualifying	temporary absence	under	IRS	code,	such	as	living	apart	due	to	college	enrollment).
- They	currently	receive	more	than	half	of	their	support	from	the	student.
- They	will	continue	to	receive	more	than	half	of	their	support	from	the	student	between	July	1,	2025,	and	June	30, 2026

If	one	or	both	of	a	student9s	parents	are	directly	or	indirectly	providing	more	than	50%	support	in	cash	or	other	assistance to	the	student9s	child,	then	the	student	could	not	claim	to	have	a	legal	dependent	who	receives	more	than	half	of	their support	from	the	student.	&lt;Indirect	support=	includes	support	that	a	parent	gives	to	the	student	on	behalf	of	the	child.	If the	student	is	living	with	a	parent	who	is	paying	for	most	of	the	household	expenses,	the	parent	would	usually	be considered	the	primary	source	of	support	to	the	student9s	child,	and	the	student	should	not	indicate	they	have	legal dependents.	However,	there	may	be	some	cases	where	the	student	can	demonstrate	that	they	provide	more	than	half	of their	child9s	support	even	while	living	at	home	with	their	parents,	in	which	case	the	student	could	indicate	they	have	legal dependents.

If	the	student	receives	money	or	other	support	for	the	legal	dependent	from	sources	other	than	their	parents,	the	student may	count	it	as	part	of	their	support	to	the	child.	Sources	include	government	programs,	such	as	Temporary	Assistance for	Needy	Families	(TANF)	and	Supplemental	Nutrition	Assistance	Program	(SNAP),	that	provide	benefits	for	dependent children.	So,	a	student	may	be	considered	independent	when	the	benefit	they	receive	is	the	primary	support	for	the	child. However,	child	support	received	from	a	noncustodial	parent	cannot	be	counted	as	part	of	the	student9s	support	to	the child.

When	a	student	completes	a	FAFSA	form	after	the	award	year	has	begun	and	indicates	they	have	a	legal	dependent	who is	not	the	student9s	child,	the	support	already	given	by	the	student	during	the	award	year	plus	the	future	support	for	the remainder	of	the	award	year	must	total	more	than	50%	for	the	whole	award	year	for	the	individual	to	meet	the	definition of	a	legal	dependent.

## Legal	Dependent	Examples

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	1: A	student	and	their	disabled	sibling	currently	live	together.	The	sibling	receives	a small	disability	payment	each	month,	but	the	student	provides	more	than	50%	support	for	the	sibling	and	expects to	continue	to	do	so	through	the	award	year.	The	sibling	is	considered	a	dependent	of	the	student	and	can	be included	in	the	student9s	family	size	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	student	is	also	an	independent	student	due	to	having a	legal	dependent.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	2: The	same	student	and	disabled	sibling	currently	live	together	and	expect	to continue	to	do	so	through	the	award	year.	The	sibling	receives	a	small	disability	payment	AND	a	pension	payment each	month.	The	combination	of	the	pension	and	the	disability	payment	will	be	enough	that	the	student	won9t	be providing	more	than	half	of	the	sibling9s	support.	Therefore,	the	student	won9t	be	able	to	include	the	sibling	in their	family	size.	Additionally,	the	student	may	or	may	not	be	independent,	depending	on	their	responses	to	other dependency	questions.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	3: A	student	is	appointed	legal	guardian	of	their	minor	cousin,	who	lives	with	the student.	The	cousin	receives	Social	Security	benefits,	which	are	paid	to	the	student	since	the	cousin	is	a	minor. These	benefits	provide	more	than	half	of	the	cousin9s	support.	Because	the	cousin	lives	with	and	is	supported	by the	student	(through	the	Social	Security	benefits)	throughout	the	award	year,	the	student	indicates	they	have	a legal	dependent	on	the	FAFSA	form	and	is	an	independent	student.	However,	if	the	cousin	did	not	live	with	the student,	the	student	can't	indicate	they	have	a	legal	dependent	and	would	only	be	independent	if	they	meet	other independent	circumstances.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	4: A	student	and	their	partner	live	together	but	are	not	married.	The	student	pays $1,500	per	month	to	support	their	partner.	The	partner	also	has	earned	income	of	$2,000	per	month	and	receives $200	per	month	from	their	parents.	The	partner	uses	all	of	this	for	their	support.	The	student	cannot	consider	their partner	a	legal	dependent	since	the	$1,500	they	provide	is	not	more	than	half	of	the	partner9s	total	support	of $3,700.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	5: In	April	2025,	a	student	applies	for	aid	for	both	2024-25	and	2025-26	award	years. One	month	prior	to	that,	their	parent	moved	in	with	the	student.	The	parent	is	undocumented	and	does	not	work or	qualify	to	receive	other	federal	benefits.	Even	though	the	student	provides	all	their	parent9s	support,	the months	of	support	for	March	through	June	2025	(the	end	of	the	2024-25	award	year)	would	not	be	more	than	50% for	2024-25	award	year.	Therefore,	the	student	cannot	claim	their	parent	as	a	legal	dependent	on	their	2024-25 FAFSA	form.	If	the	parent	had	moved	in	before	the	midpoint	of	the	year,	the	student	would	have	been	able	to count	the	parent	as	a	dependent	for	2024-25.	However,	because	the	two	plan	to	live	together	and	the	student plans	to	provide	more	than	50%	support	at	least	through	June	2026,	the	student	can	count	the	parent	as	a dependent	for	2025-26.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	6: A	student	lives	alone	with	their	infant	child.	The	infant	child9s	other	parent	pays $200	per	month	in	child	support	to	the	student.	The	student	also	receives	the	equivalent	of	$500	per	month	from government	assistance	programs	for	the	child.	The	student	provides	the	remainder	of	the	child9s	support	through part-time	work.	The	student	can	consider	the	child	a	legal	dependent	as	they	live	together	and	the	student provides	more	than	50%	of	the	child9s	support.

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	7: A	student	lives	alone	with	their	infant	child.	The	child9s	other	parent	shares custody	of	the	child	and	pays	$1,000	per	month	in	child	support	to	the	student.	The	student	receives	the equivalent	of	$500	per	month	from	government	assistance	programs	for	the	child.	The	student	does	not	work	and relies	on	the	child	support	and	government	assistance	to	support	the	child.	The	student cannot consider	the	child a	legal	dependent,	even	though	the	child	lives	with	the	student,	because	the	student	does	not	provide	more	than 50%	of	the	child9s	support.	If	the	student	is	not	otherwise	independent,	the	student	will	need	to	provide	parent information	on	the	FAFSA	form.	If	the	child9s	other	parent	is	also	a	student,	they could consider	the	child	a	legal dependent	on	their	FAFSA	form	if	the	child	lived	with	them	and	they	provide	more	than	50%	of	the	child9s	support.

## Orphan,	Ward	of	the	Court,	or	in	Foster	Care

A	student	who	is	an orphan 3	both	parents	are	dead	3	when	13	or	older	is	independent	even	if	the	student	has subsequently	been	adopted.	Likewise,	a	student	who	was,	at	any	time	since	the	age	of	13,	in foster	care or	a ward	of the	court is	independent	even	if	their	status	changed	later.

A	student	is	a	ward	of	the	court	if	a	court	has	assumed	legal	custody	of	the	student.	In	some	states	the	court	may	impose its	authority	over	a	juvenile	who	remains	in	the	legal	custody	of	their	parents;	such	a	student	is	not	a	ward	of	the	court. Also,	incarceration	of	a	student	does	not	qualify	the	student	as	a	ward	of	the	court.	In	some	states	the	phrase	&lt;ward	of	the state=	is	used;	if	it	is not due	to	incarceration,	this	is	considered	the	same	as	a	ward	of	the	court	for	dependency	status.

If	an	institution	requires	that	a	student	provide	documentation	that	they	were	in	foster	care	at	age	13	or	older,	you	must consider	any	of	the	following	documentation	to	be	adequate:

- Submission	of	a	court	order	or	official	state	documentation	that	the	student	received	federal	or	state	support	in foster	care.
- A	documented	phone	call,	written	statement,	or	verifiable	electronic	data	match	from
- a	state,	county,	or	tribal	agency	administering	a	program	under	part	B	or	E	of	Title	IV	of	the	Social	Security	Act (42	U.S.C.	621	et	seq.	and	670	et	seq.);
- a	state	Medicaid	agency;	or
- a	public	or	private	foster	care	placing	agency	or	foster	care	facility	or	placement.
- A	documented	phone	call	or	a	written	statement	from	an	attorney,	guardian	ad	litem,	or	Court	Appointed	Special Advocate.
- Verification	of	the	student9s	eligibility	for	an	education	and	training	voucher	under	the	John	H.	Chafee	Foster	Care Program	under	section	477	of	the	Social	Security	Act	(42	U.S.C.	677).
- A	documented	phone	call	or	written	statement	from	a	financial	aid	administrator	who	documented	the	student9s circumstance	in	the	same	or	a	prior	award	year.

## Emancipation	and	Legal	Guardianship

Students	are	independent	if	they	are,	or	were	upon	reaching	the	age	of	majority,	legally	emancipated	minors	(released from	control	of	their	parent	or	guardian)	or	in	legal	guardianship,	both	as	adjudicated	by	a	court	of	competent	jurisdiction in	their	state	of	legal	residence	at	the	time	of	the	adjudication.	The	emancipation	must	be	determined	by	a	court,	not	by an	attorney,	though	the	basis	for	it	can	vary	by	state.

Students	placed	in	legal	guardianship	to	their	parents4e.g.,	if	they	are	disabled	adults	and	under	their	parents9	care4are not	independent	for	Title	IV	program	purposes.	Similarly,	guardianship	of	a	person9s	estate	does	not	qualify	as	a	legal guardianship	of	the	student	for	this	purpose.	If	the	student9s	documentation	says	&lt;custody=	instead	of	&lt;guardianship,= they	should	contact	you	for	additional	guidance.	Most	states	have	a	clear	definition	of	legal	guardianship	that	is	distinct from	custody,	but	if	a	given	state	does	not,	ask	your	school9s	legal	counsel	for	help	with	this	question.

## Unaccompanied	Homeless	Youth

A	student	is	independent	if,	at	any	time	on	or	after	July	1,	2024,	the	student	is	determined	to	be	an	unaccompanied	youth who	is	homeless	or	is	self-supporting	and	at	risk	of	being	homeless.	In	determining	independence	due	to	homelessness, you	must	consider	documentation	from	any	of	the	following	entities4provided	through	a	documented	phone	call,	written statement,	or	verifiable	electronic	data	match4to	be	adequate:

- A	local	educational	agency	homeless	liaison	(or	designee),	as	designated	by	the	McKinney-Vento	Homeless Assistance	Act	(42	U.S.C.	11432(g)(1)(J)(ii)).
- The	director	(or	designee)	of	an	emergency	or	transitional	shelter,	street	outreach	program,	homeless	youth	drop-in center,	or	other	program	serving	individuals	who	are	experiencing	homelessness.
- The	director	(or	designee)	of	a	Federal	TRIO	program	or	a	Gaining	Early	Awareness	and	Readiness	for	Undergraduate program	(GEAR	UP)	grant.
- A	financial	aid	administrator	at	another	institution	who	documented	the	student9s	circumstance	in	the	same	or	a	prior award	year.

In	the	absence	of	a	determination	by	the	entities	above,	you,	the	FAA, must make	a	case-by-case	determination	of homeless	youth	status	(see	Chapter	5)	based	upon	a	written	statement	from,	or	a	documented	interview	with,	the	student that	confirms	that	they	are	an	unaccompanied	homeless	youth,	or	unaccompanied,	at	risk	of	homelessness,	and	selfsupporting.

## Apply	for	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Only	(8)

A	student	whose	parents	are	unwilling	to	provide	their	information	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	but	who	does	not	have	an unusual	circumstance	(as	defined	in Question	7 )	may	request	that	an	FAA	review	their	eligibility	for	only	a	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	by	selecting	&lt;Yes=	to	this	question.

## Family	Size	(9)

Under	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act,	family	size	(formerly	&lt;household	size=)	aligns	with	the	number	of	exemptions	(which equal	the	tax	filer(s)	plus	dependents)	claimed	on	an	individual9s	tax	return.	Individuals	who	complete	the	FAFSA	form online,	provide	the	required	consent	and	approval	to	retrieve	and	use	IRS	FTI,	and	have	their	tax	data	successfully transferred	via	the	FA-DDX	will	not	be	asked	to	report	the	size	of	their	family	as	their	family	size	will	be	derived	from	that FTI.	Instead,	these	individuals	will	be	asked	if	their	family	size	is	different	from	the	number	of	individuals	claimed	on	their tax	return.	If	they	indicate	there	was	a	change,	they	will	be	asked	to	manually	report	their	number	of	dependents	in	a follow-up	question.

On	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form,	family	size	appears	in	both	the	student	and	parent	contributor	sections.	Dependent students	are	instructed	to	skip Question	9 on	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form.	Dependent	students	completing	the	online FAFSA	form	will	not	see	the	family	size	question	in	the	student	section.

The	following	persons	are	included	in	the	family	size	of	an independent	student :

- The	student	and	their	spouse ,	unless	the	spouse	has	died	or	is	not	living	in	the	household	due	to	separation	or divorce.
- The	student9s	dependent	children ,	if	they	live	with	the	student	(or	live	apart	from	the	student	due	to	a	qualifying temporary	absence	under	IRS	code,	such	as	living	apart	due	to	college	enrollment)	and	will	receive	more	than	half	of their	support	from	the	student	(and	spouse)	from	July	1,	2025,	through	June	30,	2026.	Unborn	children	should	not	be included	in	the	family	size,	though	the	family	size	can	be	updated	if	the	child	is	born	and	will	receive	more	than	half of	their	support	from	the	student	(and	spouse)	during	the	award	year.
- Other	persons ,	who	live	with	and	receive	more	than	half	their	support	from	the	student	and	will	receive	more	than half	support	for	the	entire	award	year.	For	FAFSA	forms	submitted	after	the	start	of	the	year,	see	the	relevant paragraph	and	example	about	legal	dependents	provided	earlier	in	this	chapter	under	the	&lt;Children	and	Legal Dependents=	section.

## Family	Size	Example

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	8: A	married	student	recently	separated	from	their	spouse,	and	they	are	no	longer living	together.	They	have	a	child	together	who	is	currently	living	with	the	student9s	spouse.	The	student	is	paying child	support	to	the	spouse,	but	it	isn9t	enough	to	provide	more	than	half	the	child9s	support.	The	spouse	and	child cannot	be	included	in	the	student9s	family	size,	even	though	the	student	and	spouse	are	not	yet	legally	divorced. However,	the	student9s	nephew	lives	with	the	student	and	receives	more	than	half	of	their	support	from	the student	(and	will	do	so	for	the	award	year).	The	student	can	count	the	nephew	in	their	family	size,	which	is	two. The	nephew,	who	recently	turned	24,	is	an	independent	student	on	his	own	FAFSA	form	and	his	household	size	is one.

## Number	in	College	(10)

While	number	in	college	is	no	longer	used	to	calculate	a	student9s	SAI,	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	requires	the	question to	be	included	on	the	FAFSA	form.	Schools	can	use	the	information	provided	to	perform	a	special	circumstance	adjustment for	a	student.	See	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume	for	additional	information.

The	student	is	always	included	in	the	number	in	college.	Also	included	are	those	in	the	family	size	who	are	or	will	be enrolled	at	least	half	time	during	the	award	year	in	a	degree	or	certificate	program	at	a	Title	IV-eligible	school.

## Student	Demographic	Information	(11)	and	Student	Race	and	Ethnicity	(12)

These	questions	collect	sex/gender	and	race/ethnicity	information	about	the	student.	The	answers	to	these	questions	will not	affect	the	student9s	eligibility	for	federal	student	aid,	be	used	in	any	calculations,	or	be	shared	with	the	schools	to which	the	student	applies.	They	will	be	used	for	research	purposes	only.

## Student	Citizenship	(13)

Examples	of	eligible	noncitizen	categories	are	given	in	the	FAFSA	instructions,	and	a	detailed	discussion	of	citizenship issues	can	be	found	in	Volume	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook.	Only	U.S.	citizens	or	certain	classes	of	noncitizens	are	eligible	for Title	IV	aid;	however,	other	students	can	still	submit	the	FAFSA	form	because	they	might	be	eligible	for	aid	from institutional,	state,	or	private	sources	that	do	not	have	the	same	requirements	but	use	FAFSA	information.

Students	who	select	&lt;Eligible	noncitizen=	should	include	their	A-Number,	if	they	have	one.

## Student	State	of	Legal	Residence	(14)

This	is	used	to	determine	which	poverty	guideline	to	use	when	evaluating	eligibility	for	a	Maximum	or	Minimum	Pell	Grant for	an	independent	student.

This	is	also	used	to	determine	which	state	agency	should	receive	the	student9s	FAFSA	information.	States	have	varying criteria	for	determining	whether	the	student	is	a	resident	for	purposes	of	their	financial	aid.	However,	residing	in	one	state for	five	years	(or	more)	will	meet	any	state9s	criteria.

## Parent	Education	Status	(15)

Some	state	agencies	and	institutions	use	this	information	to	award	grants	and	scholarships.

## Parent	Killed	in	the	Line	of	Duty	(16)

A	student	may	be	eligible	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	if	they	have	a	parent	or	guardian	who	died	in	the	line	of	duty	while either	(1)	serving	on	active	duty	as	a	member	of	the	U.S.	armed	forces	on	or	after	September	11,	2001,	or	(2)	performing official	duties	as	a	public	safety	officer.	You	should	evaluate	students	who	select	&lt;Yes=	to	this	question	for	additional	Pell Grant	eligibility	under	HEA	Sec.	401(c).	See	Volume	7	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	additional	guidance.

## Special	Rule

HEA	Sec.	401(c),	as	amended	by	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act

## Student	High	School	Information	(17)

The	student	indicates	one	of	the	following	high	school	completion	statuses:

- High	school	diploma
- State-recognized	high	school	equivalent	(e.g.,	GED	certificate)
- Homeschooled
- None	of	the	previous

A	foreign	secondary	education	credential	typically	counts	as	a	high	school	diploma.

## Foreign	High	School	Diploma

## FHD-Q1	on	the	program	integrity	website

A	state-recognized	high	school	equivalent	is	what	students	receive	after	passing	a	&lt;state	authorized	examination.=	This includes	tests	comparable	to	the	GED4i.e.,	those	created	and	distributed	by	a	test	publisher4such	as	the	High	School

Equivalency	Test	(HiSET)	or	the	Test	Assessing	Secondary	Completion	(TASC),	as	well	as	those	established	by	states,	for example,	the	California	High	School	Proficiency	Exam	(CHSPE).	California	considers	a	passing	grade	on	the	CHSPE	to	be equivalent	to	a	diploma.

## Recognized	Equivalent	of	a	High	School	Diploma

## 34	CFR	600.2

&lt;None	of	the	previous=	includes	those	who	have	the	recognized	equivalent	of	a	high	school	diploma	other	than	a	staterecognized	certificate	or	who	may	qualify	under	the	Ability-to-Benefit	(ATB)	alternatives	(see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	of	the FSA	Handbook	for	additional	information	on	ATB	alternatives).

If	the	student	selects	&lt;High	School	Diploma,=	they	must	include	the	name,	city	and	state	(or	FC	for	foreign	country)	where the	student	received	or	will	receive	their	diploma.	On	the	FAFSA	website,	the	student	can	use	city	and	state	to	search	for their	high	school.	If	they	are	unable	to	find	their	high	school	using	the	search	functionality,	they	can	manually	enter	the high	school	information.	If	the	student	selects	&lt;State-recognized	high	school	equivalent,=	they	must	indicate	the equivalent	type	(GED,	TASC,	HiSET,	or	Other)	and	the	issuing	state.	See	Volume	1,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook, regarding	a	school9s	policy	about	checking	the	validity	of	a	high	school	diploma.

## Federal	Benefits	Received	(18)

A	student	may	be	eligible	to	have	their	assets	excluded	from	the	SAI	calculation	if	they	(or	someone	in	their	family) received	one	(or	more)	of	the	following	federal	benefits	during	the	2023	or	2024	calendar	years.

- Earned	income	credit	(EIC)
- Federal	housing	assistance
- Free	or	reduced-price	school	lunch*
- Medicaid
- Refundable	credit	for	coverage	under	a	qualified	health	plan	(QHP)
- Supplemental	Nutrition	Assistance	Program	(SNAP)
- Supplemental	Security	Income	(SSI)
- Temporary	Assistance	for	Needy	Families	(TANF)
- Special	Supplemental	Nutrition	Program	for	Women,	Infants,	and	Children	(WIC)

*Some	individuals	may	receive	free	or	reduced-price	school	lunch	due	to	community	eligibility	rather	than	household eligibility.	Students	should	only	indicate	they	received	free	or	reduced-price	school	lunch	on	the	FAFSA	form	if	they	meet the	income	eligibility	guidelines	published	by	the	U.S.	Department	of	Agriculture.

## Student	Tax	Filing	Status	(19)

This	three-part	question	asks	the	following:

- 1.	 If	the	student	did	(or	will)	file	a	2023	IRS	1040	or	1040-NR.
- 2.	 Whether	the	student	either	(1)	earned	income	in	a	foreign	country	in	2023,	(2)	worked	for	an	international organization	in	2023	and	was	not	required	to	report	income	on	any	tax	return,	or	(3)	filed	a	2023	tax	return	in	Puerto Rico	or	another	U.S.	territory.
- 3.	 Finally,	married	students	are	asked	if	they	filed	their	2023	tax	return	with	their	current	spouse.

Unmarried	students	who	answer	&lt;no=	to	the	first	two	parts	of	the	question	are	considered	non-tax	filers	and,	if independent,	do	not	need	to	answer	any	additional	questions	about	income	or	assets.	Married	students	who	answer	&lt;no= to	the	first	two	parts	of	the	question	will	still	need	to	provide	identity	and	contact	information	about	their	spouse.

Dependent	students	who	answer	&lt;no=	to	the	first	to	parts	of	the	question	will	still	need	to	provide	answers	to	questions about	their	assets	if	their	parents	are	required	to	provide	financial	information.

Independent	students	are	automatically	eligible	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	if	they	(and	their	spouse,	if	married)	are	not required	to	file	a	2023	federal	tax	return.	Such	students	will	be	assigned	an	SAI	of	-1,500	and	will	not	be	required	to provide	any	further	financial	information	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Individuals	who	were	married	and	filed	jointly	with	the	IRS	and	are	no	longer	married	to	the	spouse	on	the	applicable	tax return,	and/or	who	have	married	a	different	spouse,	will	be	required	to	manually	enter	their	income	and	tax	information. See	the	&lt;Joint	Return	Filers	Who	Are	No	Longer	Married=	section	in	Chapter	4	for	additional	information	on	separating	tax return	and	income	information.

Individuals	who	only	file	foreign	tax	returns	will	also	be	unable	to	use	the	FA-DDX	since	it	does	not	link	to	foreign	tax authorities.	They	will	instead	need	to	manually	input	their	income	and	tax	data	by	converting	foreign	currency	to	U.S. dollars	and	entering	the	resulting	amounts	in	the	comparable	fields	from	U.S.	tax	returns.

## Puerto	Rico	and	Other	U.S.	Territory	Residents

Some	individuals	who	reside	in	Puerto	Rico	or	another	U.S.	territory	may	use	an	IRS	Form	1040	or	1040-NR	but	file	their taxes	with	their	local	tax	authority,	not	the	IRS.	These	individuals	should	answer	&lt;No=	to	the	question	&lt;Did	or	will	the student	file	a	2023	IRS	form	1040	or	1040-NR?=	and	&lt;Yes=	to	the	subsequent	question	to	indicate	they	filed	a	tax	return with	Puerto	Rico	or	another	U.S.	territory.

Additionally,	some	individuals	who	live	and	work	in	Puerto	Rico	may	file	two	tax	returns	3	one	with	the	IRS	and	one	with the	Puerto	Rico	tax	authority.	If	they	are	filing	electronically	and	FTI	is	available	via	the	FA-DDX,	only	their	tax	information filed	with	the	IRS	will	be	imported	to	the	FAFSA	form.	They	will	not	be	able	to	manually	enter	the	information	from	their tax	return	filed	with	Puerto	Rico.	If	the	FAA	is	aware	of	this	dual	filing	scenario,	the	FAA	should	evaluate	the	applicant9s information	and	determine	if	the	information	from	the	Puerto	Rico	tax	return	should	replace	the	information	imported from	the	IRS.	FAAs	who	determine	that	the	information	from	the	Puerto	Rico	tax	return	should	be	on	the	FAFSA	should update	the	appropriate	FAFSA	fields	and	set	the	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	indicator.	While	this	is	not	a	PJ,	the	changes	to the	FAFSA	application	system	require	this	work-around	to	override	the	IRS-transferred	FTI	with	the	manually	updated	FTI. FSA	is	working	on	system	changes	for	future	application	cycles	to	allow	for	these	updates	without	setting	the	&lt;Professional Judgment=	indicator.	See	Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-23-118	for	additional	information.

## Nontax	Filers,	Foreign	Countries,	and	International	Organizations

In	some	countries	the	tax	system	does	not	operate	as	it	does	in	the	U.S.,	and	people	in	those	countries	can	earn	a substantial	amount	of	income	and	pay	taxes	without	having	to	file	a	return.	These	individuals	should	answer	&lt;No=	to	the question	&lt;Did	or	will	the	student	file	a	2023	IRS	form	1040	or	1040-NR?=	and	&lt;Yes=	to	the	subsequent	question	to	indicate they	earned	income	in	a	foreign	country.	While	these	individuals	did	not	file	taxes	in	the	U.S.,	they	are	not	eligible	for	an automatic	Maximum	Pell	Grant	and	must	manually	enter	income	and	tax	information.

In	some	instances,	employees	of	certain	international	organizations,	such	as	the	United	Nations,	the	International Monetary	Fund,	the	World	Bank,	and	others,	might	not	be	required	to	file	a	return.	These	individuals	should	answer	&lt;No= to	the	question	&lt;Did	or	will	the	student	file	a	2023	IRS	form	1040	or	1040-NR?=	and	&lt;Yes=	to	the	subsequent	question	to indicate	they	worked	for	an	international	organization.	Like	foreign	non-filers	described	above,	these	individuals	will	be required	to	manually	enter	income	and	tax	information,	as	they	are	not	eligible	to	receive	an	automatic	Maximum	Pell Grant	as	a	non-filer.

Individuals	who	earn	income	in	a	foreign	country	or	as	an	employee	of	an	international	organization	(e.g.,	World	Bank, United	Nations,	and	International	Monetary	Fund)	and	are	not	required	to	file	a	tax	return	should	fill	out	the	FAFSA	form	in the	following	way	using	U.S.	dollars:

- For	filing	status,	select	&lt;Single=	if	you9re	single	or	&lt;Married	filing	separately=	if	you9re	married.
- For	AGI,	include	all	wages,	dividends,	capital	gains,	business	income,	retirement	distributions,	and	other	income	on which	you	may	have	paid	taxes.
- For	income	tax	paid,	include	any	income	taxes	you	paid	on	income	in	your	AGI.	If	your	AGI	only	shows	your	net income	after	paying	taxes,	enter	zero	for	income	tax	paid.
- For	income	earned	from	work,	enter	the	income	from	your	AGI	that	you	earned	from	working	at	a	job	(e.g.,	your

wages	and	business	and	farm	income)	only.	This	may	be	the	same	number	as	your	AGI.

## Fiscal	Year	Tax	Returns

For	a	fiscal	year	(rather	than	calendar	year)	tax	return,	the	individual	should	use	information	from	the	return	that	includes the	greater	length	of	time	in	2023.	For	example,	an	individual	who	files	a	fiscal	year	tax	return	that	begins	in	September would	have	two	tax	returns	that	overlap	the	2023	calendar	year	3	September	1,	2022,	thru	August	31,	2023,	(FY23)	and September	1,	2023,	thru	August	31,	2024,	(FY24).	Since	the	FY23	tax	return	covers	8	months	of	the	2023	calendar	year and	the	FY24	tax	return	covers	4	months	of	the	2023	calendar	year,	the	individual	should	use	the	FY23	tax	return	that begins	on	September	1,	2022,	to	complete	the	FAFSA	form.

Note: There	are	more	days	in	the	year	between	July	1	and	December	31	(184	days)	than	between	January	1	and	June	30 (181,	or	182	in	a	leap	year).	Keep	that	in	mind	when	determining	the	length	of	time	attributed	to	a	fiscal	year	tax	return that	begins	on	July	1.

## Student	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(20)

For	U.S.	tax	filers,	much	of	the	information	in Question	20 will	be	transferred	directly	from	the	IRS	via	the	FA-DDX. However,	as	noted	previously,	there	will	be	instances	where	manual	entry	of	tax	information	will	be	necessary.

This	information	comes	directly	from	the	2023	federal	tax	return	of	the	student9s	(and	the	student9s	spouse,	if	married and	filed	jointly	with	their	current	spouse).	Non-tax	filers	will	not	be	required	to	provide	this	information.	The	first	list below	is	data	elements	that	will	transfer	via	the	FA-DDX,	if	available.	The	second	list	is	data	elements	that	the	student must	enter	manually.

## FA-DDX	Transferred	Data

- Filing	status. Single,	head	of	household,	married	filing	jointly,	married	filing	separately,	or	qualifying	surviving spouse.
- Income	earned	from	work. From	IRS	Form	1040	(or	IRS	Form	1040-NR):	line	1z	+	Schedule	1:	lines	3	+	6.
- Tax	exempt	interest	income. From	IRS	Form	1040:	line	2a.
- Untaxed	portions	of	IRA	distributions. The	filer	reports	the	full	amount,	including	rollovers,	of	the	untaxed portion,	which	is	determined	from	IRS	Form	1040:	line	4a	minus	4b.	Rollover	amounts	are	manually	entered separately	and	excluded	in	the	SAI	formula	calculation.
- Untaxed	portions	of	pensions. The	filer	reports	the	full	amount,	including	rollovers,	of	the	untaxed	portion,	which is	determined	from	IRS	Form	1040:	line	5a	minus	5b.	Rollover	amounts	are	manually	entered	separately	and excluded	in	the	SAI	formula	calculation.
- Adjusted	gross	income. From	IRS	Form	1040	(or	IRS	Form	1040-NR):	line	11.	Amount	can	be	negative.
- Income	tax	paid. From	IRS	Form	1040:	line	24
- IRA	deductions	and	payments	to	self-employed	SEP,	SIMPLE,	and	qualified	plans. From	IRS	Form	1040 Schedule	1:	total	of	lines	16	+	20.
- Education	credits.	Includes	American	Opportunity	(AOTC)	and	Lifetime	Learning	(LLC)	credits. From	IRS Form	1040:	line	29	+	IRS	Form	1040	Schedule	3:	line	3.
- Schedules	filed. Did	the	tax	filer	file	a	Schedule	A,	B,	D,	E,	F,	or	H?
- Net	business	profit	or	loss. From	IRS	Form	1040	Schedule	C:	line	31.	Amount	can	be	negative.

## Manually	Entered	Data/Manually	Provided	Tax-Payer	Data

- IRA	rollover	into	another	IRA	or	qualified	plan. Typically	indicated	as	"ROLLOVER"	on	IRS	Form	1040-line	4.
- Pension	rollover	into	an	IRA	or	other	qualified	plan. Typically	indicated	as	"ROLLOVER"	on	IRS	Form	1040-line 5.
- Earned	income	credit	(EIC)	received. IRS	Form	1040:	line	27.
- Taxable	grants,	scholarships,	or	AmeriCorps	benefits. This	question	is	optional.	The	student	should	report	only the	amount	of	grants	and	scholarships	received	(by	the	student	and	the	student9s	spouse,	if	applicable)	that	was reported	as	taxable	income	on	the	return.	This	includes	grant	and	scholarship	(not	employment)	portions	of fellowships	and	assistantships,	as	well	as	taxable	stipends	and	employer	tuition	reimbursements.	Include	AmeriCorps

benefits	(awards,	living	allowances,	and	interest	accrual	payments)	except	those	for	health	care	or	childcare. Employers	may	help	with	education	costs	by	paying	stipends	or	reimbursing	employees	for	classes	taken.	These benefits	count	as	other	financial	assistance	(or	reduce	the	cost	of	attendance)	even	if	they	aren9t	received	until	the end	of	the	class(es)	and	are	contingent	on	earning	a	minimum	grade.	Any	taxable	portion	should	be	included	in	this field.

- Foreign	earned	income	exclusion. From	IRS	Form	1040	Schedule	1:	line	8d.	This	amount	is	typically	a	negative value	on	the	tax	return.	The	SAI	formula	will	consider	the	absolute	value	of	any	negative	value	reported.

## Annual	Child	Support	Received	(21)

Annual	child	support	received	is	included	as	an	asset	of	the	recipient	in	the	SAI	formula.	If	an	independent	student	(and their	spouse,	if	married)	received	child	support	in	the	last	complete	calendar	year,	they	should	enter	the	total	amount received	for	all	children	in	the	family	size	in	this	question.

## Student	Assets	(22)

An	asset	is	property	that	the	family	owns	and	has	an	exchange	value.	The	FAFSA	form	collects	current	data	(as	of	the	day the	FAFSA	form	is	signed)	about	cash,	savings	and	checking	accounts;	investments	and	real	estate;	and	businesses	and investment	farms.

Most	assets	are investments such	as	qualified	education	benefits	or	savings	accounts,	Coverdell	education	savings accounts,	real	estate,	installment	and	land	sale	contracts	(including	mortgages	held),	trust	funds,	mutual	funds,	money market	funds,	Uniform	Gifts	and	Uniform	Transfers	to	Minors	(UGMA	and	UTMA)	accounts,	certificates	of	deposit,	stocks, stock	options,	bonds,	commodities,	and	precious	metals.	If	the	asset	isn9t	a	business	or	farm,	it	is	reported	as	an investment.

The	FAFSA	form	asks	for	the	net	worth	of	investments,	which	is	their	total	current	market	value	minus	their	associated debts.	If	their	net	worth	is	negative,	zero	should	be	reported.

Applicants	will	be	asked	to	report	the	net	worth	of all	businesses	and	farms ,	regardless	of	the	size	of	the	enterprise, location	of	the	family9s	residence	on	the	property,	or	number	of	employees.	The	current	net	worth	(the	current	market value	minus	the	debt	owed	on	it)	is	reported	for	land,	buildings,	machinery,	equipment,	livestock,	unharvested	crops,	and inventories.	However,	the	value	of	a	family9s	primary	residence	is	still	excluded,	even	if	the	residence	is	on	the	farm property	or	used	to	run	the	business.	Applicants	should	determine	the	total	net	value	of	all	farm	assets	and	subtract	the net	value	of	their	principal	residence	to	determine	the	final	value	of	their	farm	assets.	The	principal	residence	may	include the	family9s	home,	as	well	as	structures	and	land	adjacent	to	the	home	that	are	not	being	used,	stored,	or	sold	for	farming or	other	commercial	activities.	Property	values	are	generally	assessed	at	a	rate	that	considers	the	use	of	the	property	and the	value	of	the	land.	Applicants	and	their	families	may	refer	to	their	property	tax	assessments	from	municipal,	county,	or state	governments	to	help	determine	and	separate	the	value	of	their	principal	residence	from	other	property.

Qualified	education	benefits	or	education	savings	accounts include	Coverdell	savings	accounts,	529	college savings	plans,	and	the	refund	value	of	529	prepaid	tuition	plans.	For	an	independent	student,	the	accounts	owned	by	the student	(and/or	the	student9s	spouse)	are	reported	as	student	investments.	For	a	dependent	student,	an	account	is reported	as	a	parental	investment	if	the	account	is	designated	for	the	dependent	student	(accounts	designated	for	other children	in	the	family	are	not	included).	If	the	student	is	the	beneficiary	(but	not	the	owner)	of	the	account,	the	value	is not	reported	as	a	student	asset.

States,	their	agencies,	and	some	colleges	sponsor qualified	tuition	programs	(QTPs) .	The	IRS	mentions	two	types	of QTPs	that	are	commonly	called	prepaid	tuition	plans	and	college	savings	plans.	States	may	offer	both	types,	but	colleges may	only	sponsor	prepaid	tuition	plans.

Prepaid	tuition	plans	allow	a	person	to	buy	tuition	credits	or	certificates,	which	count	as	units	of	attendance.	The	number of	units	doesn9t	change	even	though	tuition	will	likely	increase	before	the	beneficiary	uses	the	tuition	credits.	They	are	an asset	of	the	plan	owner,	and	their	worth	is	the	refund	value	of	the	credits	or	certificates.

College	savings	plans	allow	a	benefactor	to	deposit	money	into	an	account	that	will	be	used	for	the	beneficiary9s	college expenses.	The	buyer	does	not	pre-purchase	tuition	credits	as	with	a	prepaid	tuition	plan.	Rather,	this	type	of	plan	is essentially	a	savings	account,	and	its	value	as	an	asset	is	the	current	balance	of	the	account.

Coverdell	education	savings	accounts,	or	ESAs,	are	another	tax-advantaged	savings	vehicle	for	college	education.	They are	treated	the	same	as	college	savings	plans:	the	current	balance	is	an	asset	of	the	account	owner.

If	distributions	from	QTPs	and	ESAs	do	not	exceed	the	qualified	education	expenses	for	which	they	are	intended,	they	are tax-free,	so	they	will	not	appear	in	the	next	year9s	AGI.	They	should	not	be	treated	as	other	financial	assistance	(OFA).	For more	information	on	these	benefits,	see	the	IRS9s	Publication	970,	Tax	Benefits	for	Education.

Rental	properties are	an	asset.	A	unit	within	a	family	home	that	has	its	own	entrance,	kitchen,	and	bath	(therefore	a rented	bedroom	would	not	count)	and	that	is	rented	to	someone	other	than	a	family	member	counts	as	an	asset.	To calculate	its	net	value,	multiply	the	net	value	of	the	entire	structure	by	the	fraction	the	rented	space	represents.	Similarly, if	a	family	owned	a	10-unit	apartment	building	and	lived	in	one	of	the	apartments,	9/10	or	90%	of	the	net	value	of	the building	would	be	an	asset.

Take-back	mortgage value	should	be	reported	as	an	asset.	In	a	take-back	mortgage,	the	seller	of	a	house	finances	a portion	of	its	cost	for	the	buyer,	who	repays	this	additional	mortgage	to	the	seller.	The	seller	reports	the	interest	part	of any	payments	received	from	the	buyer	on	Schedule	B	of	IRS	Form	1040.	Therefore,	if	such	interest	is	reported	on	a	tax return,	it	likely	indicates	an	asset	that	should	be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form:	the	value	of	the	take-back	mortgage.	There would	be	no	debt	reported	against	this	asset.	For	example,	if	an	individual	sold	their	house	for	$200,000	and	financed	a take	back	mortgage	of	$40,000	to	the	buyer,	the	seller	should	report	$40,000	as	the	net	worth	of	the	investment.	The worth	will	decrease	each	year	depending	on	how	much	of	the	principal	the	buyer	paid	back	that	year.	This	concept	applies to	other	forms	of	seller	financing	of	the	sale	of	a	home	or	other	property.

Virtual	currency (or	cryptocurrency)	such	as	Bitcoin	is	considered	an	asset.	The	value	(in	U.S.	dollars	as	of	the	day	the FAFSA	form	is	completed)	of	virtual	currency	must	be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	If	the	owner	sells	virtual	currency	and has	a	capital	gain	from	the	sale,	the	taxable	portion	will	be	in	the	AGI	for	the	year	it	is	reported	on	the	tax	return,	and	the AGI	will	then	be	included	on	the	associated	FAFSA	form.	For	more	information	on	how	the	IRS	treats	virtual	currencies, please	see	the	IRS	virtual	currency	webpage.

Uniform	Gifts	and	Uniform	Transfers	to	Minors	Acts	(UGMA	and	UTMA) allow	the	establishment	of	an	account	for gifts	of	cash	and	financial	assets	for	a	minor	without	the	expense	of	creating	a	trust.	Because	the	minor	is	the	owner	of the	account,	it	counts	as	the	minor9s	asset	on	the	FAFSA	form,	not	the	asset	of	the	custodian,	who	is	often	the	parent.

Trust	funds are	considered	an	asset	of	the	named	beneficiary	of	the	trust,	even	if	the	beneficiary9s	access	to	the	trust	is restricted.	If	the	settlor	of	a	trust	has	voluntarily	placed	restrictions	on	its	use,	then	the	beneficiary	should	report	its present	value	as	an	asset,	as	discussed	below.	If	a	trust	has	been	restricted	by	court	order,	however,	the	beneficiary should	not	report	it.	An	example	of	such	a	restricted	trust	is	one	set	up	by	court	order	to	pay	for	future	surgery	for	the victim	of	a	car	accident.

How	the	trust	must	be	reported	depends	on	whether	the	beneficiary	receives	or	will	receive	the	interest	income,	the	trust principal,	or	both.	In	the	case	of	a	divorce	or	separation	where	the	trust	is	owned	jointly	and	ownership	is	not	being contested,	the	property	and	the	debt	are	equally	divided	between	the	owners	for	reporting	purposes	unless	the	terms	of the	trust	specify	some	other	method	of	division.

If	a	beneficiary	receives interest	only from	the	trust,	any	interest	received	in	the	base	year	must	be	reported	as	income. If	the	interest	accumulates	and	is	not	paid	out,	the	recipient	must	report	an	asset	value	for	the	interest	they	will	receive. The	trust	officer	can	usually	calculate	the	value	of	the	interest	the	person	will	receive	while	the	trust	exists.	This	value represents	the	amount	a	third	person	would	be	willing	to	pay	for	the	interest	income.

The	person	who	will	receive principal	only from	the	trust	must	report	the	present	value	of	his	or	her	right	to	that principal	as	an	asset.	For	example,	if	a	$10,000	principal	reverts	to	a	student9s	parent	when	the	trust	ends	in	ten	years and	the	student	is	receiving	the	interest,	the	student	would	report	the	interest	received	as	income	and	the	present	value of	the	student9s	parent9s	rights	to	the	principal	is	reported	as	an	asset	of	the	parent	(if	the	student	is	required	to	report parental	data)	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.	The	present	value	of	the	principal	can	be	calculated	by	the	trust	officer;	it9s the	amount	that	a	third	person	would	pay	for	the	right	to	receive	the	principal	ten	years	from	now4basically,	the	amount that	one	would	have	to	deposit	now	to	receive	$10,000	in	ten	years.

If	a	beneficiary	receives	both interest	and	principal from	the	trust,	the	beneficiary	should	report	the	present	value	of both	interest	and	principal,	as	described	in	the	discussion	of	principal	only.	If	the	trust	is	set	up	so	that	the	interest accumulates	within	the	trust	until	it	ends,	the	beneficiary	should	report	the	present	value	of	the	interest	and	principal	that they	are	expected	to	receive	when	the	trust	ends	as	an	asset.

In	some	cases,	ownership	of	an	asset	may	be divided	or	contested ,	which	can	affect	how	the	owner	reports	the	asset.	If the	owner	has	only	part	ownership	of	an	asset,	the	owner	should	report	only	the	owned	part.	Generally,	the	value	of	an asset	and	debts	against	it	should	be	divided	equally	by	the	number	of	people	who	share	ownership	unless	the	share	of	the asset	is	determined	by	the	amount	invested	or	the	terms	of	the	arrangement	specify	some	other	means	of	division.

If ownership	is	contested ,	the	asset	should	not	be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	For	instance,	if	a	couple	is	separated and	can9t	sell	or	borrow	against	jointly	owned	property	because	it9s	being	contested,	the	net	worth	of	the	property	would not	be	reported	as	an	asset.	If	ownership	of	an	asset	is	resolved	after	the	initial	application	is	filed,	the	value	cannot	be updated.	If	there9s	a lien	against	the	asset ,	the	net	value	of	the	asset	is	determined	by	subtracting	any	associated	debt and	the	amount	of	the	lien	from	its	total	value.	If	foreclosure	of	an	asset	is	imminent,	the	net	value	of	the	asset	would	still be	reported	until	the	party	making	the	foreclosure	completes	legal	action	to	take	possession	of	the	asset.	If	the	status	of the	property	changes	after	the	application	is	filed,	the	value	cannot	be	updated.

## Excluded	Assets

The	following	are excluded	assets and	should	not	be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form:

- Possessions such	as	a	car	for	personal	use,	a	sound	system,	clothes,	or	furniture.
- A	family9s principal	place	of	residence ,	even	if	it	is	part	of	a	business	or	farm	property.
- Retirement	and	life	insurance	plans	and	ABLE	accounts. An	ABLE	account	is	a	tax-advantaged	savings	account for	a	disabled	person	and	their	family;	its	value	does	not	count	as	an	asset	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	value	of retirement	plans4401(k)	plans,	pension	funds,	annuities,	noneducation	IRAs,	Keogh	plans,	etc.4also	is	not	counted as	an	asset,	but	distributions	do	count	as	income.	An	exception	to	reporting	pension	distributions	is	when	they	are rolled	over	into	another	retirement	plan	in	the	same	tax	year	(rollover).	Similarly,	the	cash	value	or	equity	of	a	whole life	insurance	policy	isn9t	reported	as	an	asset,	but	an	insurance	settlement	may	count	as	income	if	it	is	included	in the	student9s	AGI.
- Excluded	assets	for	Native	American	students. The	law	excludes	reporting	any	income	and	asset	of	$2,000	or less	per	individual	payment	(any	amount	over	$2,000	is	reported	as	an	asset	of	the	recipient)	received	under	the	Per Capita	Act	or	the	Indian	Tribal	Judgment	Funds	Use	or	Distribution	Act.	It	also	excludes	any	income	received	under the	Alaska	Native	Claims	Settlement	Act	or	the	Maine	Indian	Claims	Settlement	Act.	Per	capita	distributions	or	the proceeds	received	from	the	Land	Buy-Back	Program	for	Tribal	Nations4a	tribal	purchase	of	fractionated	lands because	of	the	Cobell	settlement	under	the	Claims	Resolution	Act	of	2010	(42	U.S.C.	1305)4should	also	be	excluded.

HEA	Sec.	479C

## Colleges	(23)

For	a	school	to	be	able	to	receive	the	student's	data,	the	student	must	list	the	college9s	federal	school	code	(not	the	OPE ID)	or	enter	its	complete	name,	address,	city,	and	state.	There	is	a	federal	school	code	search	in	the	online	FAFSA	form, and	the	entire	list	of	school	codes	is	available	as	a	Microsoft	Excel	spreadsheet	and	an	Adobe	PDF	document	on	the Knowledge	Center	website	under	the	Library	section9s	&lt;Publications	by	Resource	Type=	area.

The	student	can	list	up	to	10	schools	on	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	and	20	on	the	web	(at	least	one	school	is	required).	If a	student	wants	their	information	to	be	available	to	more	schools,	they	can	change	the	schools	listed	online	or	use	their FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	The	FPS	will	send	data	to	no	more	than	20	(10	with	the	PDF	FAFSA	form)	schools	at	a	time. Chapter	4	explains	how	students	can	add	or	change	schools.

The	ISIR	will	only	display	the	federal	school	code	of	the	receiving	school.	The	information	of	other	schools	the	student included	on	the	FAFSA	form	will	not	appear	except	on	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and	on	ISIRs	sent	to	state	grant agencies.	See	Volume	6	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA	Specification	Guide.

## Student	Consent,	Approval,	and	Signature	(24)

Every	student must provide	the	following	to	be	eligible	for	Title	IV	aid:

- Consent 3	The	student	must	consent	to	the	disclosure	of	certain	identifying	information	to	the	IRS.
- Approval 3	The	student	must	affirmatively	approve	that	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	may	receive,	use,	and redisclose	to	certain	entities	their	federal	tax	information	(FTI).
- Signature 3	The	student9s	FSA	ID	(account	username	and	password)	will	serve	as	their	signature	on	the	online FAFSA	form.	Paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	filers	will	provide	a	physical	signature	on	their	form.

In	addition	to	certifying	that	the	data	on	the	FAFSA	form	is	correct,	the	student	is	also	signing	a	statement	of	educational purpose,	which	is	required	to	receive	Title	IV	funds.	Among	other	things,	the	student	agrees	to	spend	Title	IV	funds	only on	educational	expenses	and	affirms	that	they	are	not	in	default	on	a	federal	loan	and	do	not	owe	a	grant	overpayment.

## FAFSA	Submission

Students	who	do	not	have	any	other	required	contributors	now	have	a	complete	FAFSA	form.	Students	who	complete	and submit	their	FAFSA	form	online	will	receive	an	email	version	of	their	confirmation	page.	When	the	applicant9s	FAFSA	form is	processed,	students	who	provided	an	email	address	will	receive	an	email	notification	of	processing	with	instructions	to access	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	Students	who	do	not	provide	an	email	address	will	receive	a	paper	copy	of	their FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	Applicants	with	additional	required	contributors	will	need	these	individuals	to	contribute	to their	FAFSA	form,	as	described	next.

## Contributor:	Student	Spouse

This	section	consists	of	five	questions	related	to	the	student9s	spouse.	The	student9s	spouse	is	a	required	contributor	on the	FAFSA	form	if	the	student	is	married	and	did	not	file	a	2023	tax	return	jointly	with	their	current	spouse.

If	a	married	student	is	completing	the	FAFSA	form	online	and	the	student9s	spouse	is	identified	as	a	required	contributor, the	student	will	be	prompted	to	enter	their	spouse9s	identity	information	(name,	Social	Security	number,	date	of	birth,	and email	address)	to	invite	them	to	contribute	to	their	FAFSA	form.	The	student	spouse	will	be	notified	by	email	that	they have	been	invited	to	contribute	to	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.	The	spouse	should	use	their	own	StudentAid.gov	account username	and	password	to	access	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	and	complete	their	portion	of	the	form.	If	the	student9s spouse	is	not	a	required	contributor,	the	student	will	enter	the	same	identifying	information	and	email	address,	but	the student9s	spouse	will	not	be	invited	to	contribute	to	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.

If	the	student	is	completing	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form,	they	will	have	their	spouse	complete	the	student	spouse contributor	section.

## Student	Spouse	Identity	Information	(25)

Like	the	student,	the	student	spouse	identity	information	should	match	what	appears	on	their	social	security	card.	If	the student	spouse	does	not	have	a	Social	Security	number	and	is	completing	their	section	of	the	form	online,	the	SSN	field will	be	blank,	based	on	their	StudentAid.gov	account	information.	If	they	are	completing	their	section	on	the	paper	(PDF) FAFSA,	they	should	enter	all	zeros	in	the	SSN	field.	In	both	application	methods,	the	student	spouse	should	enter	their ITIN,	if	they	have	one,	in	the	ITIN	field.

## Student	Spouse	Contact	Information	(26)

This	is	the	student	spouse9s	current	mobile	phone,	email	address,	and	permanent	home	address.

## Student	Spouse	Tax	Filing	Status	(27)

This	question	asks	if	a	2023	IRS	Form	1040	or	1040-NR	was	(or	will	be)	completed.	It	also	asks	about	income	earned	in	a foreign	country	or	if	the	student	spouse	filed	a	tax	return	in	a	U.S.	territory.	See	the	&lt;Student	Tax	Filing	Status	(19)= question	for	additional	information.

## Student	Spouse	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(28)

This	information	comes	directly	from	the	student	spouse9s	2023	tax	return.	See	the	discussion	of	tax	return	data	in	the &lt;Student	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(20)=	question	for	a	list	of	data	elements	that	will	transfer	via	the	FA-DDX	or	be manually	entered	by	the	student	spouse.	Unlike	the	student,	the	student9s	spouse	will	not	be	asked	to	report	taxable college	grants,	scholarships,	or	AmeriCorps	benefits.	If	the	student	or	spouse	had	an	amount	to	report,	the	student	should have	reported	the	joint	total	in	the	student	section.	The	spouse	will	also	not	be	asked	about	receipt	of	the	earned	income tax	credit	(EITC).	Receipt	of	the	EITC	is	used	to	determine	if	the	student	(or	parent)	is	a	single	parent.	If	the	student	(or parent)	is	married,	they	are	not	a	single	parent,	which	makes	it	unnecessary	to	ask	the	spouse	about	the	EITC.

## Student	Spouse	Consent,	Approval,	and	Signature	(29)

Every	student	spouse	contributor	must	provide	the	following	for	the	student	to	be	eligible	for	Title	IV	aid:

- Consent 3	The	student	spouse	contributor	must	consent	to	the	disclosure	of	certain	identifying	information	to	the IRS.
- Approval 3	The	student	spouse	contributor	must	affirmatively	approve	that	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	may receive,	use,	and	redisclose	to	certain	entities	their	federal	tax	information	(FTI).
- Signature 3	The	student	spouse	contributor9s	FSA	ID	(username	and	password)	will	serve	as	their	signature	on	the online	FAFSA.	Paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	filers	will	provide	a	physical	signature	on	their	form.

## FAFSA	Submission

Married,	independent	students	who	did	not	file	a	2023	tax	return	jointly	with	their	current	spouse	now	have	a	complete FAFSA	ready	for	submission.	The	student	will	receive	an	email	confirmation	that	the	form	was	submitted.	The	spouse	will see	an	abbreviated	confirmation	that	the	form	is	complete	and	that	the	student	has	been	notified.	Applicants	who	provide an	email	address	will	receive	email	notification	when	their	form	is	processed	with	instructions	to	access	their	FAFSA Submission	Summary.	Students	who	do	not	provide	an	email	address	will	receive	a	paper	copy	of	their	FAFSA	Submission Summary.

## Contributor:	Parent

This	section	consists	of	12	questions	related	to	the	parent	of	a	dependent	student.

Dependent	students	will	always	have	at	least	one	parent	contributor.	If	the	student	is	completing	the	FAFSA	form	online, they	will	be	prompted	to	enter	their	parent9s	identity	information	(name,	Social	Security	number,	date	of	birth,	and	email address)	to	invite	them	to	contribute	to	their	FAFSA	form.	The	parent	will	be	notified	by	email	that	they	have	been	invited to	contribute	to	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.	The	parent	should	use	their	own	StudentAid.gov	account	username	and password	to	access	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	and	complete	their	portion	of	the	form.	If	the	student9s	parent	is	married and	filed	their	2023	taxes	jointly	with	their	current	spouse,	only	one	parent	contributor	is	required.	If	the	student9s	parent is	either	(1)	married	or	remarried,	or	(2)	unmarried	and	living	together,	and	did	not	file	their	2023	taxes	jointly	with	their current	spouse	or	partner,	the	parent9s	spouse	or	partner	will	be	a	required	contributor	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.

If	the	student	is	completing	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form,	they	will	have	their	parent	complete	the	parent	section.

## Who	Counts	as	a	Parent	on	the	FAFSA?

In	most	cases,	it9s	clear	who	the	parents	are.	A	parent	is	a	biological	or	adoptive	parent,	or	a	person	that	the	state	has determined	to	be	a	parent	(for	example,	when	a	state	allows	another	person9s	name	to	be	listed	as	a	parent	on	a	birth certificate).	A	stepparent	is	considered	a	parent	if	married	to	a	biological	or	adoptive	parent	and	if	the	student	counts them	in	their	family	size.	Biological	and	adoptive	parents	who	are	unmarried	and	living	together	select	that	as	their marital	status,	and	both	report	their	information	on	the	FAFSA	form.

However,	a	stepparent	who	did	not	adopt	the	student	cannot	be	the	sole	parent	for	determining	dependency	status.	If	one parent	dies,	the	student	is	still	a	dependent	of	the	remaining	biological	or	adoptive	parent,	not	the	stepparent.

## Surviving	Parent	and	Stepparent	Example

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	9: A	dependent	student9s	parents	divorced	when	the	student	was	five	years	old.	The student9s	mother	remarried,	and	the	student	lived	with	her	and	the	student9s	stepfather,	who	did	not	adopt	the student.	The	student9s	mother	died	last	year,	but	the	student9s	biological	father	is	still	living.	The	student	does	not meet	any	of	the	criteria	to	be	independent.	Because	the	student9s	biological	father	is	the	only	surviving	parent, the	student	needs	to	report	the	biological	father9s	information	on	the	FAFSA	form,	even	if	the	student	is	still	living with	and	being	supported	by	the	stepfather.

If	parents	are	divorced	or	never	married	and	not	living	together,	the	parent	on	the	FAFSA	form	should	be	the	parent	who provided	more	than	50%	of	the	financial	support	for	the	student	during	the	last	12	months.	This	may	be	different	from	the parent	the	student	lived	with	during	that	same	period.	If	one	parent	pays	child	support	and/or	alimony	to	the	other	parent, the	amount	paid	counts	for	the	payer	when	determining	which	parent	provided	more	than	50%	of	the	student9s	financial support	and	is	a	required	contributor	on	the	FAFSA	form.	Once	the	parent	who	provides	more	than	50%	of	the	financial support	for	the	student	has	been	determined,	that	parent	(and	their	current	spouse,	if	applicable)	should	report	their financial	information	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	as	a	contributor.

If	neither	parent	provided	more	than	50%	of	the	financial	support	for	the	student	(including	when	neither	parent	provided support	for	the	student)	during	the	last	12	months,	the	parent	with	the	greater	income	and	assets	is	a	required contributor	on	the	FAFSA	form.	Once	the	parent	with	the	greater	income	and	assets	has	been	determined,	that	parent (and	their	current	spouse,	if	applicable)	should	report	their	financial	information	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.

Note:	It	is	not	typical	that	a	student	will	receive	support	from	both	parents	exactly	equally.	Usually,	you	can	determine that	the	student	received	more	than	half	support	from	one	of	the	parents.

A	foster	parent	or	a	legal	guardian	is	not	treated	as	a	parent	for	Title	IV	purposes.	If	at	any	time	since	the	age	of	13	both student9s	parents	were	dead	(and	they	did	not	have	an	adoptive	parent	at	that	time)	or	the	student	was	in	foster	care, they	are	independent.	If	the	student	is	now	or	was	when	they	became	an	adult	an	emancipated	minor	or	in	legal guardianship,	the	student	is	independent.

If	a	student	is	living	with	their	grandparents	or	other	relatives,	their	data	should	not	be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form	as parental	data	unless	they	have	adopted	the	student.

## Student	Living	With	Relatives	Example

AVG,	Chapter	2,	Example	10: A	student9s	father	is	dead,	and	the	student9s	mother	can9t	support	the	student, so	the	student	is	living	with	their	grandparents.	The	student9s	mother	doesn9t	pay	any	money	for	the	student9s support.	The	student	doesn9t	meet	any	of	the	independence	criteria,	so	the	student	must	provide	parental information.	Because	the	student9s	grandparents	haven9t	adopted	the	student,	they	are	not	the	student9s	parents. The	student	will	have	to	provide	information	about	their	mother	on	the	form	unless	there	are	unusual circumstances	that	would	warrant	a	dependency	override	or	the	student	may	elect	to	receive	only	unsubsidized loans.	See	Chapter	5	for	additional	guidance	on	unusual	circumstances.

## Parent	Identity	Information	(30)

does	not	have	a	Social	Security	number	and	is	completing	their	section	of	the	form	online,	the	SSN	field	will	automatically be	blank,	based	on	the	information	in	the	StudentAid.gov	account.	If	the	parent	is	completing	their	section	of	the	form using	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA,	they	should	enter	all	zeros	in	the	SSN	field.	In	both	application	methods,	the	parent	should enter	their	ITIN,	if	they	have	one,	in	the	ITIN	field.

## Parent	Contact	Information	(31)

This	is	the	parent9s	current	mobile	phone,	email	address,	and	permanent	home	address.

## Parent	Current	Marital	Status	(32)

This	is	the	parent9s	marital	status	&lt;as	of	today=	3	the	day	the	application	is	signed.	Marital	status	cannot	be	projected.	It can	be	updated	in	limited	circumstances;	see	Chapter	4.

A	student9s	parent	in	a	relationship	that	meets	the	criteria	for	common-law	marriage	in	their	state	of	legal	residence should	select	&lt;married=.	If	the	state	doesn9t	consider	their	situation	to	be	a	common-law	marriage	or	doesn9t	recognize common-law	marriage,	then	they	aren9t	married;	parents	would	report	that	they	are	unmarried	and	living	together.	Check with	the	appropriate	state	agency	concerning	the	definition	of	a	common-law	marriage.

## Parent	State	of	Legal	Residence	(33)

This	is	used	to	determine	which	poverty	guideline	to	use	when	evaluating	eligibility	for	a	Maximum	or	Minimum	Pell	Grant for	a	dependent	student.

## Family	Size	(34)

See	&lt;Family	Size	(9)=	in	the	student	section	for	further	explanation	of	family	size	for	online	filers.

For	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	filers,	family	size	appears	in	both	the	student	and	parent	contributor	sections	of	the	form.	The information	reported	in	the	parent	section	of	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form	will	supersede	information	reported	in	the student	section,	if	applicable.

The	following	persons	are	included	in	the	family	size	of	a dependent	student :

- The	student
- The	parent	(and	their	spouse	or	partner)
- The	parent9s	dependent	children ,	(even	if	they	live	apart	from	the	parents	due	to	a	qualifying	temporary	absence under	IRS	code,	such	as	living	apart	due	to	college	enrollment)	who	will	receive	more	than	half	of	their	support	from the	parent	(and	spouse	or	partner)	from	July	1,	2025,	through	June	30,	2026.	Unborn	children	should	not	be	included in	the	family	size,	though	the	family	size	can	be	updated	if	the	child	is	born	and	will	receive	more	than	half	of	their support	from	the	parent	(and	spouse	or	partner)	during	the	award	year.
- Other	persons who	live	with	and	receive	more	than	half	their	support	from	the	parent	(and	spouse	or	partner)	and will	receive	more	than	half	support	for	the	entire	award	year.

## Number	in	College	(35)

While	number	in	college	is	no	longer	used	to	calculate	a	student9s	SAI,	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	requires	the	question to	be	included	on	the	FAFSA	form.	Schools	can	use	the	information	provided	to	perform	a	special	circumstance	adjustment for	a	student.	See	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	in	Chapter	5:	Special	Cases	of	this	volume	for	additional	information.

The	student	is	always	included	in	the	number	in	college.	Also	included	are	those	in	the	family	size	who	are	or	will	be enrolled	at	least	half	time	during	the	award	year	in	a	degree	or	certificate	program	at	a	Title	IV-eligible	school.

## Federal	Benefits	Received	(36)

A	student	may	be	eligible	to	have	their	and	their	parents9	assets	excluded	from	the	SAI	calculation	if	they	(or	someone	in their	family)	received	one	(or	more)	federal	benefits	during	the	2023	or	2024	calendar	years.	See	the	&lt;Federal	Benefits

Received	(18)=	question	for	a	list	of	these	federal	benefits.

## Parent	Tax	Filing	Status	(37)

This	question	asks	if	the	parent	filed	(or	will	file)	a	2023	IRS	1040	or	1040-NR.	If	the	answer	is	&lt;no=,	the	parent	will	be asked	to	select	one	of	the	following	reasons	for	not	filing:

- 1.	 The	parent	filed	or	will	file	a	tax	return	with	Puerto	Rico	or	another	U.S.	territory.
- 2.	 The	parent	filed	or	will	file	a	foreign	tax	return.
- 3.	 The	parent	either	earned	income	in	a	foreign	country	but	did	not	and	will	not	file	a	foreign	tax	return,	or	worked	for an	international	organization	and	was	not	required	to	report	income	on	any	tax	return.
- 4.	 The	parent,	even	though	they	earned	income	in	the	U.S.,	did	not	and	will	not	file	a	U.S.	tax	return	because	their income	was	below	the	filing	threshold.
- 5.	 The	parent	did	not	and	will	not	file	a	U.S.	tax	return	for	reasons	other	than	low	income.
- 6.	 The	parent	did	not	and	will	not	file	any	tax	return	because	they	did	not	earn	any	income	or	they	were	not	required	to file	under	the	Internal	Revenue	Code.

The	purpose	of	these	questions	is	to	determine	if	a	parent	was	either	(1)	required	to	file	a	2023	U.S.	federal	tax	return	and did	not	or	(2)	has	income	from	a	foreign	country	that	must	be	manually	entered	on	the	FAFSA	form.

A	dependent	student	will	be	automatically	eligible	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	if	their	parent	(and	parent9s	spouse	or partner)	is	subject	to	the	U.S.	Tax	Code	but	is	not	required	to	file	a	2023	U.S.	federal	tax	return.	The	student	will	be assigned	an	SAI	of	-1,500	and	will	not	be	required	to	provide	any	further	financial	information	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Finally,	married	parents	are	asked	if	they	filed	their	2023	tax	return	with	their	current	spouse.	Individuals	who	were married	and	filed	jointly	with	the	IRS	and	are	no	longer	married	to	the	spouse	on	the	applicable	tax	return,	or	who	have married	a	different	spouse,	will	be	required	to	manually	enter	their	income	and	tax	information.	See	the	&lt;Joint	Return Filers	Who	Are	No	Longer	Married=	section	in	Chapter	4	for	additional	information	on	separating	tax	return	and	income information.

Individuals	who	only	file	foreign	tax	returns	will	also	be	unable	to	use	the	FA-DDX	since	it	does	not	link	to	foreign	tax authorities.	They	will	instead	need	to	manually	input	their	income	and	tax	data	by	converting	foreign	currency	to	U.S. dollars	and	entering	the	resulting	amounts	in	the	comparable	fields	from	U.S.	tax	returns.	See	the	&lt;Student	Tax	Filing Status	(19)=	question	for	additional	information.

If	the	parent	indicates	they	earned	income	in	a	foreign	country	but	did	not	file	a	foreign	tax	return,	or	worked	for	an international	organization,	such	as	the	United	Nations,	World	Bank,	or	International	Monetary	Fund	(option	3),	they	will need	to	manually	input	their	income	and	tax	data,	similar	to	individuals	who	file	foreign	tax	returns.	See	&lt;Non-tax	filers, foreign	countries,	and	international	organizations=	under	&lt;Student	Tax	Filing	Status	(19)=	for	additional	guidance.

If	a	parent	indicates	they	did	not	file	a	U.S.	tax	return	for	reasons	other	than	low	income	(option	5),	you	should	treat	this as	conflicting	information	and	request	documentation	to	resolve	it,	which	may	include	requiring	the	individual	to	file	a	tax return	and	present	sufficient	documentation	of	filing	to	you.

If	a	parent	indicates	they	did	not	file	any	tax	return	because	they	did	not	earn	any	income	(option	6)	and	their	state	of legal	residence	is	a	foreign	country,	you	must	determine	if	the	parent	has	foreign	untaxed	income	that,	when	included	in the	SAI	calculation,	impacts	a	student9s	Pell	Grant	eligibility.	Comment	code	303	on	the	student9s	ISIR	should	prompt	you to	request	additional	documentation.	If	your	inquiry	into	the	parents9	financial	situation	shows	that	the	student	might	be eligible	for	less	or	no	Pell	grant	funds,	you	may	use	PJ	to	account	for	the	parents9	untaxed	income	and	assets,	similar	to the	action	you	might	take	when	there	is	a	substantial	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	on	a	U.S.	tax	return	that	can	affect a	student9s	Pell	eligibility.

## Parent	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(38)

For	U.S.	tax	filers,	much	of	the	information	in	Question	38	will	be	transferred	directly	from	the	IRS	via	the	FA-DDX.

However,	there	will	be	instances	where	manual	entry	of	tax	information	will	be	necessary.

This	information	comes	directly	from	the	2023	federal	tax	return	of	the	parent9s	(and	parent9s	spouse	if	married	and	filed jointly	with	their	current	spouse).	See	the	discussion	of	tax	return	data	in	the	&lt;Student	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(20)= question	for	a	list	of	data	elements	that	will	transfer	via	the	FA-DDX	or	be	manually	entered	by	the	parent.

## Annual	Child	Support	Received	(39)

Annual	child	support	received	is	included	as	an	asset	of	the	recipient	in	the	SAI	formula.	If	a	dependent	student9s	parent (and	their	spouse	or	partner)	received	child	support	in	the	last	complete	calendar	year,	they	should	enter	the	total amount	received	for	all	children	in	the	family	size	in	this	question.

## Parent	Assets	(40)

An	asset	is	property	that	the	family	owns	and	has	an	exchange	value.	The	FAFSA	form	collects	current	data	(as	of	the	day of	signing	the	FAFSA	form)	about	cash,	savings,	and	checking	accounts;	investments;	real	estate;	businesses;	and investment	farms.	See	the	&lt;Student	Assets	(22)=	question	for	additional	discussion	of	assets.

## Parent	Consent,	Approval,	and	Signature	(41)

Every	parent	contributor must provide	the	following	for	the	student	to	be	eligible	for	Title	IV	aid:

- Consent 3	The	parent	contributor	must	consent	to	the	disclosure	of	certain	identifying	information	to	the	IRS.
- Approval 3	The	parent	contributor	must	affirmatively	approve	that	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	may	receive, use,	and	redisclose	to	certain	entities	their	federal	tax	information	(FTI).
- Signature 3	The	parent	contributor9s	FSA	ID	(username	and	password)	will	serve	as	their	signature	on	the	online FAFSA.	Paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	filers	will	provide	a	physical	signature	on	their	form.

## FAFSA	Submission

A	dependent	student	with	a	single	parent	now	has	a	complete	FAFSA	ready	for	submission.	A	dependent	student	with married	parents	who	filed	their	2023	tax	return	jointly	with	their	current	spouse	will	need	to	provide	the	parent9s	spouse9s identity	and	contact	information.	If	all	required	information	is	provided	and	the	FAFSA	form	is	submitted,	the	student	will receive	an	email	confirmation.	The	parent	will	see	an	abbreviated	confirmation,	letting	them	know	that	the	form	is complete	and	that	the	student	has	been	notified.	Applicants	who	provide	an	email	address	will	receive	email	notification when	their	form	is	processed	with	instructions	to	access	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	Students	who	do	not	provide an	email	address	will	receive	a	paper	copy	of	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.

## Contributor:	Parent	Spouse	or	Partner

This	section	consists	of	five	questions	related	to	the	spouse	or	partner	of	a	parent	of	a	dependent	student.	If	the	student9s parent	is	married,	the	spouse9s	information	is	always	required	on	the	FAFSA	form.	If	the	student9s	parent	is	unmarried	and living	with	a	partner,	the	partner9s	information	is	only	required	on	the	FAFSA	form	if	the	partner	is	also	the	student9s	legal parent.

The	parent	spouse	or	partner	is	only	a	required	contributor	on	the	FAFSA	form	if	the	parent	is	either	(1)	married	or remarried	and	did	not	file	taxes	jointly	with	their	current	spouse	in	2023,	or	(2)	unmarried	and	living	with	the	student9s other	legal	parent.	If	the	parent	contributor	is	completing	the	FAFSA	form	online	and	the	parent9s	spouse	is	identified	as	a required	contributor,	the	parent	will	be	prompted	to	enter	the	parent	spouse9s	or	partner9s	identity	information	(name, Social	Security	number,	date	of	birth,	and	email	address)	to	invite	them	to	contribute	to	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.	The parent	spouse	or	partner	will	be	notified	by	email	that	they	have	been	invited	to	contribute	to	the	student9s	FAFSA	form. The	spouse	or	partner	should	use	their	own	StudentAid.gov	account	username	and	password	to	access	the	student9s FAFSA	form	and	complete	their	portion	of	the	form.	If	the	parent9s	spouse	is	not	a	required	contributor,	the	parent	will enter	the	same	identifying	information	and	email	address,	but	the	parent9s	spouse	will	not	be	invited	to	contribute	to	the student9s	FAFSA	form.

If	the	student	is	completing	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form,	they	will	have	their	parent9s	spouse	or	partner	complete	the parent	spouse	or	partner	contributor	section.

## Parent	Spouse	or	Partner	Identity	Information	(42)

Like	the	student,	the	parent	spouse	or	partner	identity	information	should	match	what	appears	on	their	social	security card.	If	the	parent	spouse	or	partner	does	not	have	a	Social	Security	number	and	is	completing	their	section	of	the	form online,	the	SSN	field	will	automatically	be	blank	based	on	the	information	in	their	StudentAid.gov	account.	If	the	parent spouse	is	completing	their	section	using	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA,	they	should	enter	all	zeros	in	the	SSN	field.	In	both application	methods,	the	parent	should	enter	their	ITIN,	if	they	have	one,	in	the	ITIN	field.

## Parent	Spouse	or	Partner	Contact	Information	(43)

This	is	the	parent	spouse9s	or	partner9s	current	mobile	phone,	email	address,	and	permanent	home	address.

## Parent	Spouse	or	Partner	Tax	Filing	Status	(44)

This	question	asks	if	the	parent	spouse	or	partner	filed	(or	will	file)	a	2023	IRS	1040	or	1040-NR.	It	also	asks	about	income earned	in	a	foreign	country	or	if	the	parent	spouse	or	partner	filed	a	tax	return	in	a	U.S.	territory.	See	the	discussion	of	tax return	data	in	the	&lt;Student	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(20)=	question	for	a	list	of	data	elements	that	will	transfer	via	the FA-DDX	or	be	manually	entered	by	the	parent	spouse	or	partner.

## Parent	Spouse	or	Partner	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(45)

This	information	comes	directly	from	the	parent	spouse9s	or	partner9s	2023	federal	tax	return.	See	the	discussion	of	tax return	data	in	the	&lt;Student	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(20)=	question	for	a	list	of	data	elements	that	will	transfer	via	the FA-DDX	or	be	manually	entered	by	the	parent	spouse	or	partner.	Unlike	the	parent,	the	parent	spouse	or	partner	will	not be	asked	to	report	either	(1)	taxable	college	grants,	scholarships,	or	AmeriCorps	benefits,	or	(2)	receipt	of	the	earned income	credit.	See	&lt;Student	Spouse	2023	Tax	Return	Information	(28)=	for	further	explanation	of	these	two	excluded elements.

## Parent	Spouse	or	Partner	Consent,	Approval,	and	Signature	(46)

Every	parent	spouse	or	partner	contributor must provide	the	following	for	the	student	to	be	eligible	for	Title	IV	aid:

- Consent 3	The	parent	spouse	or	partner	contributor	must	consent	to	the	disclosure	of	certain	identifying	information to	the	IRS.
- Approval 3	The	parent	spouse	or	partner	must	affirmatively	approve	that	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	may receive,	use,	and	redisclose	to	certain	entities	their	federal	tax	information	(FTI).
- Signature 3	The	parent	spouse	or	partner	contributor9s	FSA	ID	(username	and	password)	will	serve	as	their signature	on	the	online	FAFSA.	Paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	filers	will	provide	a	physical	signature	on	their	form.

## FAFSA	Submission

A	dependent	student	with	(1)	unmarried	parents	living	together	or	(2)	a	married	or	remarried	parent	who	did	not	file	their 2023	tax	return	jointly	with	their	current	spouse	now	have	a	complete	FAFSA	form	ready	for	processing.	The	student	will receive	an	email	confirmation	that	their	FAFSA	form	is	complete.	The	parent	spouse	or	partner	will	see	an	abbreviated confirmation	that	the	form	is	complete,	and	that	the	student	has	been	notified.	If	the	applicant	provided	an	email	address, they	will	receive	an	email	when	the	FAFSA	form	is	processed	with	instructions	for	accessing	their	FAFSA	Submission Summary.	Applicants	without	an	email	address	will	receive	a	paper	copy	of	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.

## Role:	Preparer

If	someone	other	than	the	student,	student	spouse,	parent,	or	parent	spouse	or	partner	completed	a	portion	of	the	FAFSA form	on	the	applicant9s	behalf,	that	person	must	complete	the	Preparer	section. Paid	preparers	are	prohibited. This section	consists	of	three	questions	related	to	the	unpaid	preparer.

Note: This	section	appears	on	the	paper	(PDF)	FAFSA	form,	but	the	Preparer	role	will	not	be	available	in	the	online FAFSA	form	for	the	2025-26	award	year.

## Preparer	Identity	Information	(47)

First	name,	last	name,	and	either	Social	Security	number	(SSN)	or	Employer	Identification	Number	(EIN).

## Preparer	Contact	Information	(48)

This	is	the	preparer9s	affiliation	or	organization	and	mailing	address.

## Preparer	Signature	(49)

The	preparer	must	sign	and	date	the	FAFSA	form.

## Chapter	3

## Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility

A	student	may	qualify	for	a	Pell	Grant	in	one	of	three	ways:

- Maximum	Pell	Grant	(Max	Pell)
- Minimum	Pell	Grant	(Min	Pell)
- Calculated	Pell	Grant,	based	on	SAI	(Calculated	Pell	=	Max	Pell	minus	SAI)

The	first	two	paths	to	Pell	Grant	eligibility	are	briefly	discussed	below.	See	Volume	7	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	additional information	on	Pell	Grant	eligibility.	Most	of	this	chapter	is	spent	discussing	how	the	SAI	is	calculated.

## General	Information

The	FAFSA	Processing	System	(FPS)	uses	data	provided	by	the	applicant	and	contributors	on	the	FAFSA	form	to	determine Max	or	Min	Pell	Grant	eligibility	and	calculate	the	SAI.

## Maximum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Criteria

A	student	is	eligible	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	if	any	of	the	following	is	true:

## Dependent	Student

- The	student9s	parent(s)	is	not	required	to	file	a	federal	income	tax	return;	or
- The	student9s	parent	is	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	greater	than	zero	and	less	than	or	equal	to	225%	of	the poverty	guideline	for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence;	or
- The	student9s	parent	is	not	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	greater	than	zero	and	less	than	or	equal	to	175%	of	the poverty	guideline	for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence.

## Independent	Student

- The	student	(and	spouse,	if	applicable)	is	not	required	to	file	a	federal	income	tax	return;	or
- The	student	is	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	greater	than	zero	and	less	than	or	equal	to	225%	of	the	poverty guideline	for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence;	or
- The	student	is	not	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	greater	than	zero	and	less	than	or	equal	to	175%	of	the	poverty guideline	for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence.

## SAI	for	Maximum	Pell	Grant	Recipients

A	dependent	student	whose	parents	are	not	required	to	file	a	federal	income	tax	return	OR	an	independent	student	(and spouse,	if	applicable)	who	is	not	required	to	file	a	federal	income	tax	return	for	the	prior-prior	tax	year	is	assigned	an	SAI equal	to	-1500.	Other	students	eligible	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	will	be	assigned	an	SAI	equal	to	0	or	a	calculated	SAI, whichever	is	less.

## Maximum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility

```
HEA	Sec.	401(b)(1)(A)
```

Minimum	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Criteria

A	student	who	does	not	qualify	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant	or	for	a	calculated	Pell	Grant	because	the	SAI	is	too	high	can	still be	eligible	for	a	Minimum	Pell	Grant	if	any	of	the	following	is	true:

## Dependent	Student

- The	student9s	parent	is	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	less	than	or	equal	to	325%	of	the	poverty	guideline	for	the applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence;	or
- The	student9s	parent	is	not	a	single	parent	and	has	an	AGI	less	than	or	equal	to	275%	of	the	poverty	guideline	for	the applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence.

## Independent	Student

- The	student	is	a	single	parent,	and	the	AGI	is	less	than	or	equal	to	400%	of	the	poverty	line;	or
- The	student	is	a	parent	and	is	not	a	single	parent,	and	the	AGI	is	less	than	or	equal	to	350%	of	the	poverty	guideline for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence;	or
- The	student	is	not	a	parent,	and	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s	if	applicable)	AGI	is	less	than	or	equal	to	275%	of	the poverty	guideline	for	the	applicant9s	family	size	and	state	of	residence.

## SAI	for	Minimum	Pell	Grant	Recipients

## Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	Formulas

The	SAI	formulas	use	income,	assets,	and	the	number	of	persons	in	the	family	size	for	the	award	year.

The	law	gives	three	SAI	formulas:

- 1.	 Formula	A	3	Dependent	students,
- 2.	 Formula	B	3	Independent	students	without	dependents	other	than	a	spouse,	and
- 3.	 Formula	C	3	Independent	students	with	dependents	other	than	a	spouse

## SAI	Formulas

HEA	Sec.	474-479

Tables	used	in	the	computation	of	the	SAI	are	updated	annually	and	published	on	the	Knowledge	Center	in	a	Federal Register.	The	Department9s	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	is	also	updated	annually	and available	at	fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center	in	the	Library	section	under	Resource	Type	&gt;	Handbooks,	Manuals,	or Guides.

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	eliminated	the	simplified	needs	test	and	automatic	zero	provisions.	However,	some applicants	will	be	exempt	from	reporting	assets	and/or	will	have	assets	excluded	from	consideration	in	the	SAI	formula.

## Applicants	Exempt	From	Asset	Reporting

A dependent	student is	exempt	from	asset	reporting	if	they	meet	one	of	the	following	criteria.

- 1.	 The	applicant	qualifies	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant
- 2.	 The	applicant9s	parents9	2023	combined	AGI	is	less	than	$60,000	and	they	do	not	file	a	Schedule	A,	B,	D,	E,	F,	or	H, AND
- a.	 They	do	not	file	a	Schedule	C, OR
- b.	 They	file	a	Schedule	C	with	net	business	income	of	not	more	than	a	$10,000	loss	or	gain.
- 3.	 The	applicant	or	applicant9s	parent	received	a	benefit	under	a	means-tested	Federal	benefit	program	during	the	2023 or	2024	calendar	year.

Exception: A	dependent	student	is	not	exempt	from	asset	reporting	if	their	parents	(1)	live	outside	the	U.S. or (2)	do	not file	taxes	in	the	U.S.	or	a	U.S.	territory,	unless	their	nonfiling	is	due	to	having	income	below	the	filing	threshold.

An independent	student is	exempt	from	asset	reporting	if	they	meet	one	of	the	following	criteria.

- 1.	 The	applicant	qualifies	for	a	Maximum	Pell	Grant
- 2.	 The	applicant9s	(and	applicant9s	spouse,	if	applicable)	2023	combined	AGI	is	less	than	$60,000	and	they	do	not	file	a Schedule	A,	B,	D,	E,	F,	or	H, AND
- a.	 They	do	not	file	a	Schedule	C, OR
- b.	 They	file	a	Schedule	C	with	net	business	income	of	not	more	than	a	$10,000	loss	or	gain.
- 3.	 The	applicant	or	applicant9s	spouse	received	a	benefit	under	a	means-tested	federal	benefit	program	during	the	2023 or	2024	calendar	year.

## Means-Tested	Federal	Benefits	Programs

The	means-tested	federal	benefit	programs	are	listed	in	Chapter	2.	A	person	need	not	have	received	the	benefit	for	an entire	year;	receiving	it	at	any	time	in	the	base	or	following	year	qualifies.	Also,	an	FAA	may	use	professional	judgment (PJ)	to	count	a	benefit	if	a	person	did	not	receive	it	during	those	24	months	but	is	receiving	it	now.

## No	Prorated	SAIs

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	does	not	allow	schools	to	use	alternate	or	prorated	SAIs	when	packaging	students	for	periods other	than	9	months.	Therefore,	you	should	use	the	calculated	SAI	to	package	a	student,	regardless	of	the	length	of	time of	the	student9s	enrollment.

## The	SAI	Worksheets

The	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	contains	SAI	worksheets	and	tables	for	each	formula (A,	B	and	C),	which	can	be	used	to	manually	calculate	an	SAI	or	to	see	how	the	SAI	is	determined	for	each	of	the	formulas.

The	following	information	provides	additional	insight	into	the	SAI	calculation	process	and	may	prove	helpful	when reviewing	the	SAI	worksheets	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.

## Formula	A	3	Dependent	Students

The	SAI	for	a	dependent	student	is	calculated	using	the	FAFSA	data	for	the	student	and	their	parents.	The	FPS	calculates the	parents9	contribution	from	income	and	assets,	the	student9s	contribution	from	income,	and	the	student9s	contribution from	assets;	the	SAI	is	the	sum	of	these	three	values.

## Parents9	Contribution	From	Available	Income	and	Assets

Parents9	available	income. The	parents9	available	income	is	calculated	by	subtracting	certain	allowances	from	the parents9	total	income.	These	allowances	account	for	certain	nondiscretionary	expenses,	such	as	taxes	and	basic	living expenses.	Once	a	minimum	level	of	support	has	been	offset	for	those	expenses,	the	formula	assumes	that	the	remaining income	is	available	for	discretionary	purposes,	including	paying	for	a	postsecondary	education.	The	available	income	can be	a	negative	number.

The	total	income	is	the	sum	of	the	taxable	and	untaxed	income,	minus	amounts	reported	in	the	income	but	excluded	from the	formula.

Parents9	taxed/untaxed	income. The	sum	of	following	items,	reported	on	a	U.S.	tax	return,	increases	the	parents9	total income:

- Parents9	AGI
- Parents9	deductible	payments	to	self-employed	SEP,	SIMPLE,	Keogh,	and	other	qualified	retirement	accounts
- Tax-exempt	interest
- Untaxed	IRA/pension	distributions	(excluding	rollovers)
- Foreign	income	exclusion

Parents9	income	offsets. The	sum	of	the	following	items	decreases	the	parents9	total	income:

- Parents9	taxable	college	grant	and	scholarship	aid	(included	as	income). This	amount	is	self-reported	on	the FAFSA	form.
- Parents9	education	credits. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Parents9	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS). Schools	annually	report	FWS	earnings	by	individual	earners	to	the Department.	ED	will	then	use	this	information	to	report	FWS	on	the	individual	earner9s	FAFSA	form.

Parents9	income	allowances. The	sum	of	the	following	allowances	reduces	the	parents9	total	income:

- U.S.	income	tax	paid. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Parents9	payroll	tax	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	A1:Payroll	Tax	Allowance=	in	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	Apply	the	rates	shown	in	each	step	of	the	table	to	the	total	income	earned	from	work	in	2023 for	both	parents	(as	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form).	The	total	allowance	for	payroll	taxes	is	never	less	than	zero.
- Income	protection	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	A2:	Income	Protection	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index (SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	This	allowance	is	for	the	basic	living	expenses	of	a	family.	It	varies	according	to the	number	in	the	parents9	family	size,	as	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	In	general,	a	school	can	assume	that	30%	of the	income	protection	allowance	amount	is	for	food,	22%	for	housing,	9%	for	transportation	expenses,	16%	for clothing	and	personal	care,	11%	for	medical	care,	and	12%	for	other	family	consumption.
- Employment	expense	allowance. This	allowance	recognizes	extra	expenses	incurred	by	families	with	working parents.	The	maximum	allowance	is	updated	annually.	See	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant Eligibility	Guide	for	the	current	year	allowance	amount.	The	employment	expense	allowance	is	never	less	than	zero.

Parents9	contribution	from	assets. The	full	formula	uses	the	assets	of	parents	of	a	dependent	student	and	determines a	&lt;contribution	from	assets.=	This	amount	is	combined	with	available	income	to	quantify	the	family9s	financial	strength.

First,	the	parents9 net	worth is	calculated	by	adding	the	following	assets	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

- Cash,	savings,	checking,	time	deposits,	and	money	market	funds. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA form.
- Net	worth	of	investments. Includes	real	estate	(excluding	primary	residence),	vacation	homes,	income	producing property,	trusts,	stocks,	bonds,	derivatives,	securities,	mutual	funds,	tax	shelters,	and	qualified	education	benefits.
- Adjusted	net	worth	of	business	and/or	investment	farm. Use	&lt;Table	A3:	Business/Farm	Net	Worth	Adjustment= in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	to	adjust	the	total	reported	on	the	FAFSA.
- Child	support	received. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	Child	support	received	should	be	reported	as the	total	amount	received	in	the	most	recently	completed	calendar	year.	For	example,	if	the	FAFSA	form	is completed	in	January	2024,	the	amount	of	child	support	received	should	be	the	total	for	the	2023	calendar	year.

Second,	the	parents9 discretionary	net	worth is	calculated	by	subtracting	the	asset	protection	allowance	(&lt;Table	A4:

Asset	Protection	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide)	from	the	parents9	net worth.	Discretionary	net	worth	may	be	less	than	zero.

Finally,	the	discretionary	net	worth	is	multiplied	by	the	conversion	rate	of	12%	to	get	the parents9	contribution	from assets ,	which	represents	the	portion	of	parental	assets	considered	available	to	help	pay	for	the	student9s	college education.	If	the	contribution	from	assets	is	negative,	it	is	set	to	zero.

Calculation	of	parents9	contribution. This	is	the	final	step	in	determining	the	parents9	contribution.	The	parents9 available	income	and	contribution	from	assets	are	added	together	to	determine	the	parents9	adjusted	available	income, which	can	be	a	negative	number.	The	total	parents9	contribution	from	adjusted	available	income	is	calculated	from	the amounts	and	rates	in	&lt;Table	A5:	Parents9	Contribution	from	Adjusted	Available	Income=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index (SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	The	rates	in	Table	A5	increase	from	22%	to	47%	as	the	adjusted	available	income increases.	This	is	based	on	the	principle	that	as	income	increases	beyond	the	amount	needed	to	maintain	a	basic standard	of	living,	the	portion	used	for	family	maintenance	decreases	and	the	portion	available	for	discretionary	purposes increases.	Therefore,	a	progressively	larger	amount	of	income	may	be	contributed	toward	postsecondary	educational costs.	The	parents9	contribution	from	adjusted	available	income	may	be	negative.

## Student9s	Contribution	From	Income

Student9s	available	income. The	student9s	available	income	is	calculated	by	subtracting	certain	allowances	from	the student9s	total	income.	These	allowances	account	for	certain	nondiscretionary	expenses,	such	as	taxes	and	basic	living expenses.	Once	a	minimum	level	of	support	has	been	offset	for	those	expenses,	the	formula	assumes	that	the	remaining income	is	available	for	discretionary	purposes,	including	paying	for	a	postsecondary	education.

The	student9s	available	income	is	the	sum	of	the	taxable	and	untaxed	income,	minus	amounts	reported	in	the	income	but excluded	from	the	formula	(offsets	and	allowances).

Student9s	taxed/untaxed	income. The	sum	of	the	following	items,	reported	on	a	U.S.	tax	return,	is	the	student9s	total income:

- Student9s	AGI
- Student9s	deductible	payments	to	self-employed	SEP,	SIMPLE,	Keogh,	and	other	qualified	retirement	accounts
- Student9s	tax-exempt	interest
- Student9s	untaxed	IRA/pension	distributions	(excluding	rollovers)
- Student9s	foreign	income	exclusion

Student9s	income	offsets. The	sum	of	the	following	items	decreases	the	student9s	total	income:

- Student9s	taxable	college	grant	and	scholarship	aid	(included	as	income). This	amount	is	self-reported	on the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	education	credits. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS). Schools	annually	report	FWS	earnings	by	individual	earners	to	the Department.	ED	will	then	use	this	information	to	report	FWS	on	the	individual	earner9s	FAFSA	form.

Student9s	income	allowances. The	sum	of	the	following	allowances	reduces	the	student9s	total	income:

- U.S.	income	tax	paid. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	payroll	tax	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	A1:	Payroll	Tax	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI) and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	Apply	the	rates	shown	in	each	step	of	the	table	to	the	total	income	earned	from	work in	2023	for	the	student	(as	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form).	The	total	allowance	for	payroll	taxes	is	never	less	than	zero.
- Income	protection	allowance. This	amount	is	set	annually.	See	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant Eligibility	Guide	for	the	current	year	allowance	amount.
- Allowance	for	parents9	negative	adjusted	available	income. If	the	parents9	adjusted	available	income	is negative,	enter	the	amount	as	a	positive	amount	in	the	calculation.	If	the	value	is	positive,	set	this	allowance	to	0.

Finally,	the	student9s	available	income	is	multiplied	by	the	assessment	rate	of	50%	to	determine	the	student9s contribution	from	income,	which	may	be	a	negative	number	(as	low	as	-1,500).

## Student9s	Contribution	From	Assets

The	full	formula	uses	the	student9s	assets	and	determines	a	&lt;contribution	from	assets.=

First,	the	student9s net	worth is	calculated	by	adding	the	following	assets	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

- Cash,	savings,	checking,	time	deposits,	and	money	market	funds. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA form.
- Net	worth	of	investments. Includes	real	estate	(excluding	primary	residence),	vacation	homes,	income	producing property,	trusts,	stocks,	bonds,	derivatives,	securities,	mutual	funds,	tax	shelters,	and	qualified	education	benefits.
- Adjusted	net	worth	of	business	and/or	farm. Use	&lt;Table	A3:	Business/Farm	Net	Worth	Adjustment=	in	the	202526	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	to	adjust	the	total	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Second,	the	student9s net	worth is	multiplied	by	the	conversion	rate	of	20%	to	get	the student9s	contribution	from assets .	If	the	contribution	from	assets	is	negative,	it	is	set	to	zero.

## SAI	Calculation	3	Dependent	Student

The	student9s	SAI	is	determined	by	adding	the	parents9	contribution,	the	student9s	contribution	from	available	income, and	the	student9s	contribution	from	assets.	The	SAI	may	be	negative	(but	not	less	than	-1,500).

## Formula	B4Independent	Student	Without	Dependents	Other	Than	a Spouse

The	SAI	for	an	independent	student	without	dependents	other	than	a	spouse	is	calculated	using	FAFSA	data	for	the student	and	spouse.	The	FPS	calculates	a	contribution	from	available	income	and	a	contribution	from	assets;	the	SAI	is	the sum	of	these	two	values.

## Contribution	From	Available	Income

Student9s	(and	Spouse9s)	available	income. The	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	available	income	is	calculated	by subtracting	certain	allowances	from	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total	income.	These	allowances	account	for	certain nondiscretionary	expenses,	such	as	taxes	and	basic	living	expenses.	Once	a	minimum	level	of	support	has	been	offset	for those	expenses,	the	formula	assumes	that	the	remaining	income	is	available	for	discretionary	purposes,	including	paying for	a	postsecondary	education.	The	available	income	can	be	a	negative	number.

The	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	available	income	is	the	sum	of	the	taxable	and	untaxed	income	minus	amounts	reported	in the	income	but	excluded	from	the	formula	(offsets	and	allowances).

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	taxed/untaxed	income. The	sum	of	the	following	items,	reported	on	a	U.S.	tax	return,	is	the student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total	income:

- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	AGI
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	deductible	payments	to	self-employed	SEP,	SIMPLE,	Keogh,	and	other	qualified	retirement accounts
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	tax-exempt	interest
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	untaxed	IRA/pension	distributions	(excluding	rollovers)
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	foreign	income	exclusion

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	income	offsets. The	sum	of	the	following	items	decreases	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total income:

- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	taxable	college	grant	and	scholarship	aid	(included	as	income). This	amount	is self-reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	education	credits. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS). Schools	annually	report	FWS	earnings	by	individual earners	to	the	Department.	ED	will	then	use	this	information	to	report	FWS	on	the	individual	earner9s	FAFSA	form.

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	income	allowances. The	sum	of	the	following	allowances	reduces	the	student9s	(and spouse9s)	total	income:

- U.S.	income	tax	paid. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	payroll	tax	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	B1:	Payroll	Tax	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	Apply	the	rates	shown	in	each	step	of	the	table	to	the	total	income earned	from	work	in	2023	for	the	student	(and	spouse)	as	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	total	allowance	for payroll	taxes	is	never	less	than	zero.
- Income	protection	allowance. This	amount	differs	for	unmarried	students	(single,	separated,	divorced,	or widowed)	and	married	students	(married	or	remarried).	See	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant Eligibility	Guide	for	the	current	year	allowance	amount.
- Employment	expense	allowance. If	the	student	is	not	married	(single,	separated,	divorced,	or	widowed)	this allowance	is	$0.	If	the	student	is	married	(or	remarried),	this	allowance	is	35%	of	the	student	and	spouse9s	combined earned	income	or	maximum	allowance,	whichever	is	less.	The	allowance	is	updated	annually.	See	the	2025-26 Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	for	the	current	year	allowance	amount.	The	employment expense	allowance	is	never	less	than	zero.

Finally,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	available	income	is	multiplied	by	the	assessment	rate	of	50%	to	determine	the student9s	contribution	from	income,	which	may	be	a	negative	number.

## Student9s	(and	Spouse9s)	Contribution	From	Assets

The	full	formula	uses	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	assets	of	the	and	determines	a	&lt;contribution	from	assets.=

First,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) net	worth is	calculated	by	adding	the	following	assets	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form:

- Cash,	savings,	checking,	time	deposits,	and	money	market	funds. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA form.
- Net	worth	of	investments. Includes	real	estate	(excluding	primary	residence),	vacation	homes,	income	producing property,	trusts,	stocks,	bonds,	derivatives,	securities,	mutual	funds,	tax	shelters,	and	qualified	education	benefits.
- Adjusted	net	worth	of	business	and/or	investment	farm. Use	&lt;Table	B2:	Business/Farm	Net	Worth	Adjustment= in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	to	adjust	the	total	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Second,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) discretionary	net	worth is	calculated	by	subtracting	the	asset	protection allowance	(&lt;Table	B3:	Asset	Protection	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide) from	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	net	worth.

Finally,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) net	worth is	multiplied	by	the	conversion	rate	of	20%	to	determine	the	student9s contribution	from	assets.	If	the	contribution	from	assets	is	negative,	it	is	set	to	zero.

## SAI	Calculation	3	Independent	Student	Without	Dependents	Other	Than	a Spouse

The	student9s	SAI	is	determined	by	adding	the	student9s	contribution	from	income	and	the	student9s	contribution	from assets.	The	SAI	may	be	negative	(but	not	less	than	-1,500).

## Formula	C4Independent	Student	With	Dependents	Other	Than	a	Spouse

The	SAI	for	an	independent	student	with	dependents	other	than	a	spouse	is	calculated	using	FAFSA	data	for	the	student and	spouse.	The	FPS	calculates	a	contribution	from	available	income	and	a	contribution	from	assets;	the	SAI	is	the	sum	of these	two	values.

## Contribution	Fom	Available	Income

Student9s	(and	Spouse9s)	available	income. The	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	available	income	is	calculated	by subtracting	certain	allowances	from	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total	income.	These	allowances	account	for	certain nondiscretionary	expenses,	such	as	taxes	and	basic	living	expenses.	Once	a	minimum	level	of	support	has	been	offset	for those	expenses,	the	formula	assumes	that	the	remaining	income	is	available	for	discretionary	purposes,	including	paying for	a	postsecondary	education.	The	available	income	can	be	a	negative	number.

The	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	available	income	is	the	sum	of	the	taxable	and	untaxed	income	minus	amounts	reported	in the	income	but	excluded	from	the	formula	(offsets	and	allowances).

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	taxed/untaxed	income. The	sum	of	the	following	items,	reported	on	a	U.S.	tax	return,	is	the student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total	income:

- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	AGI
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	deductible	payments	to	self-employed	SEP,	SIMPLE,	Keogh,	and	other	qualified	retirement accounts
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	tax-exempt	interest
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	untaxed	IRA/pension	distributions	(excluding	rollovers)
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	foreign	income	exclusion

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	income	offsets. The	sum	of	the	following	items	decreases	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	total income:

- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	taxable	college	grant	and	scholarship	aid	(included	as	income). This	amount	is self-reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	education	credits. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	Federal	Work-Study	(FWS). Schools	annually	report	FWS	earnings	by	individual earners	to	the	Department.	ED	will	then	use	this	information	to	report	FWS	on	the	individual	earner9s	FAFSA	form.

Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	income	allowances. The	sum	of	the	following	allowances	reduces	the	student9s	(and spouse9s)	total	income:

- U.S.	income	tax	paid. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
- Student9s	(and	spouse9s)	payroll	tax	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	C1:	Payroll	Tax	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	Apply	the	rates	shown	in	each	step	of	the	table	to	the	total	income earned	from	work	in	2022	for	the	student	(and	spouse)	as	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	total	allowance	for payroll	taxes	is	never	less	than	zero.
- Income	protection	allowance. Use	&lt;Table	C2:	Income	Protection	Allowance	3	Married	with	Dependents=	in	the 2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	for	married	or	remarried	students.	Use	&lt;Table	C3: Income	Protection	Allowance	3	Single	with	Dependents=	for	unmarried	students	(single,	separated,	divorced,	or widowed)	and	married	students	(married	or	remarried).
- Employment	expense	allowance. The	allowance	is	35%	of	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	income	earned	from	work or	a	maximum	allowance,	whichever	is	less.	The	maximum	allowance	is	updated	annually.	See	the	2025-26	Student Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	for	the	current	year	allowance	amount.	The	employment	expense allowance	is	never	less	than	zero.

## Student9s	(and	Spouse9s)	Contribution	From	Assets

The	full	formula	uses	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	assets	and	determines	a	&lt;contribution	from	assets.=

First,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) net	worth is	calculated	by	adding	the	following	assets	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

- Cash,	savings,	checking,	time	deposits,	and	money	market	funds. Use	the	amount	reported	on	the	FAFSA form.
- Net	worth	of	investments. Includes	real	estate	(excluding	primary	residence),	vacation	homes,	income	producing property,	trusts,	stocks,	bonds,	derivatives,	securities,	mutual	funds,	tax	shelters,	and	qualified	education	benefits.
- Adjusted	net	worth	of	business	and/or	farm. Use	&lt;Table	C4:	Business/Farm	Net	Worth	Adjustment=	in	the	202526	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide	to	adjust	the	total	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Second,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) discretionary	net	worth is	calculated	by	subtracting	the	asset	protection allowance	(&lt;Table	C5:	Asset	Protection	Allowance=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide)

from	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s)	net	worth.

Finally,	the	student9s	(and	spouse9s) net	worth is	multiplied	by	the	conversion	rate	of	7%	to	get	the student9s contribution	from	assets .	If	the	contribution	from	assets	is	negative,	it	is	set	to	zero.

## SAI	Calculation	-	Independent	Student	With	Dependents	Other	Than	a Spouse

This	is	the	final	step	in	determining	the	student9s	SAI.	The	student9s	available	income	and	contribution	from	assets	are added	together	to	determine	the	student9s	adjusted	available	income,	which	can	be	a	negative	number.	The	total student9s	contribution	from	adjusted	available	income	is	calculated	from	the	amounts	and	rates	in	&lt;Table	C6:	Assessment from	Adjusted	Available	Income=	in	the	2025-26	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Pell	Grant	Eligibility	Guide.	The	rates	in	Table C6	increase	from	22%	to	47%	as	the	adjusted	available	income	increases.	This	is	based	on	the	principle	that	as	income increases	beyond	the	amount	needed	to	maintain	a	basic	standard	of	living,	the	portion	used	for	family	maintenance decreases	and	the	portion	available	for	discretionary	purposes	increases.	Therefore,	a	progressively	larger	amount	of income	may	be	contributed	toward	postsecondary	educational	costs.	The	number	resulting	from	the	assessment according	to	Table	C6	is	the	student9s	SAI	and	may	be	negative.

## Chapter	4

## Verification,	Updates,	and	Corrections

Because	students	sometimes	make	errors	on	their	application,	there	is	a	process	for	verifying	applications	and	making corrections.	The	FAFSA	Processing	System	(FPS)	selects	which	applications	are	to	be	verified,	but	you	also	have	the authority	to	verify	additional	students.

You	must	verify	applications	selected	by	the	FPS	of	students	who	will	receive	or	have	received	subsidized	Title	IV	aid,	as defined	below.	Verification	is	not	required	for	students	who	are	only	eligible	for	unsubsidized	Title	IV	aid	(however,	see &lt;Verification	exclusions=	later	in	this	chapter	for	an	important	caveat).	While	graduate	students	are	ineligible	for	most types	of	subsidized	Title	IV	aid,	they	are	eligible	for	Federal	Work-Study	and	would	need	to	complete	verification	if	they are	selected	and	receive	that	aid.	Students	who	are	eligible	for	both	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	Title	IV	aid	may	not avoid	verification	by	accepting	only	unsubsidized	aid;	they	must	complete	verification	to	receive	any	Title	IV	aid	(see	the &lt;Disbursing	unsubsidized	aid=	section	later	in	this	chapter	for	more	information).

## Subsidized	student	financial	assistance	programs

## Unsubsidized	student	financial	assistance	programs

34	CFR	668.52	&lt;Unsubsidized	student	financial	assistance	programs=

## Required	Policies	and	Procedures

Your	school	must	have	written	policies	and	procedures	about	the	following:

- The	time	in	which	students	must	submit	verification	documentation;
- The	consequences	for	failing	to	submit	those	documents	in	time;
- The	method	you	use	to	notify	students	if	their	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI)	and	Title	IV	aid	amounts	change;
- The	procedures	you	or	students	follow	to	correct	FAFSA	data;	and
- The	procedure	you	follow	to	refer	a	student	to	the	Office	of	Inspector	General	(OIG)	(see	Chapter	5	of	this	volume).

Your	school	must	provide	the	following	to	students	selected	for	verification	in	a	timely	manner:

- A	clear	explanation	of	their	role	in	the	process,
- A	list	of	documents	they	need	to	submit,	and
- Deadlines	they	must	meet	and	the	consequences	of	failing	to	meet	them.

The	FSA	Assessments	are	located	as	additional	resources	in	the	FSA	Handbook	portion	of	the	Knowledge	Center.	You	can use	the	verification	assessment	to	evaluate	your	verification	process.	In	addition,	the	Department	has	a	list	of	questions and	answers	about	verification	located	within	our	Program	Integrity	Q	&amp;	A	website.

## Policies	and	Procedures

## Verification	Selection	and	Professional	Judgment	(PJ)

You	must	complete	verification	for	a	selected	student	before	you	exercise	professional	judgment	(PJ)	to	adjust	any	values used	to	calculate	the	SAI. But	a	PJ	adjustment	does	not	require	you	to	verify	an	application	not	selected	for verification.

Once	the	Department	selects	a	FAFSA	application	for	verification,	every	subsequent	transaction	for	that	award	year,	even one	resulting	from	PJ,	will	indicate	that	the	student	is	selected	for	verification.

If	a	FAFSA	that	is	not	selected	for	verification	is	later	corrected,	that	can	result	in	the	application	being	selected.	However, when	professional	judgment	is	used	to	adjust	an	application	that	is	not	selected	for	verification	and	the	FAA	correctly indicates	the	PJ	flag	on	the	ISIR,	the	FPS	prevents	the	subsequent	transaction	from	being	selected	for	verification.

## Verification	and	PJ

## 34	CFR	668.53(c)

## Applications	and	Information	to	be	Verified

A	menu	of	potential	verification	items	for	each	award	year	will	be	published	in	the	Federal	Register.	The	Department published	2025-26	FAFSA	information	to	be	verified	and	acceptable	documentation	in	the	September	4,	2024	Federal Register	Notice	(89	FR	71893).

A	student9s	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	and	Institutional	Student	Information	Record	(ISIR)	will	indicate	if	a	student	is selected	for	verification.	On	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary,	there	will	be	an	asterisk	(*)	next	to	the	SAI	and	a	comment in	the	&lt;Application	Status=	section	informing	the	student	that	their	school	has	the	authority	to	ask	for	additional documentation	to	complete	verification.	Applicants	will	need	to	verify	all	the	FAFSA	items	that	apply	to	them.	On	the	ISIR, you	will	see	a	verification	indicator	tracking	flag	set	to	a	value	of	&lt;Y=	and	a	verification	tracking	group	(V1,	V4,	or	V5)	to indicate	placement	in	one	of	the	verification	tracking	groups.

## Verification	items

## 34	CFR	668.56

## Acceptable	documentation

34	CFR	668.57

## School-Selected	Verification

In	some	cases,	you	(the	school)	may	choose	to	select	a	student	for	verification.	You	must	verify	any	information	you	have reason	to	believe	is	incorrect	on	an	application.	You	may	also,	at	your	discretion,	require	a	student	to	verify	any	FAFSA information	and	provide	reasonable	documentation	according	to	consistently	applied	school	policies.	In	either	case	you may,	but	are	not	required	to,	include	any	of	the	FPS	verification	items	not	already	included.	Students	selected	for verification	by	the	school	are	subject	to	the	same	verification	requirements	as	FPS-selected	applications,	including deadlines,	allowable	tolerances,	and	interim	disbursement	rules.

When	schools	choose	to	verify	an	item	other	than	those	the	Department	selects,	they	may	delay	disbursing	Title	IV	aid until	verification	is	completed	if	the	school-selected	item	can	affect	the	student9s	Title	IV	eligibility,	such	as	an	item	about dependency	status.	But	schools	cannot	delay	disbursing	Title	IV	funds	when	the	item	has	no	bearing	on	Title	IV	aid.	For example,	if	your	school	is	verifying	home	equity	of	a	family9s	primary	residence	to	determine	student	eligibility	for	school or	state	aid,	you	may	not	delay	Title	IV	disbursements	as	the	value	of	the	family9s	primary	residence	is	excluded	from assets	in	the	SAI	formula.

## Verification	Tracking	Groups

Students	who	are	selected	for	verification	by	the	Department	will	be	placed	in	one	of	three	verification	groups	(V1,	V4,	or V5)	to	determine	which	FAFSA	information	must	be	verified.	Groups	V2,	V3,	and	V6	are	reserved	for	future	use	by	the Department.

## V14Standard	Verification	Group

Tax	filers (student,	student	spouse,	parent,	and	parent	spouse/partner,	as	applicable)	must	verify	the	following:

- Adjusted	gross	income
- Income	earned	from	work
- U.S.	income	tax	paid
- Untaxed	portions	of	IRA	distributions
- Untaxed	portions	of	pensions
- IRA	deductions	and	payments
- Tax	exempt	interest	income
- Education	Credits
- Foreign	income	exempt	from	federal	taxation
- Family	size

Non-tax	filers (student,	student	spouse,	parent,	and	parent	spouse/partner,	as	applicable)	must	verify	the	following:

- Income	earned	from	work
- Family	size

## V44Custom	Verification	Group

Students	must	verify	the	following:

- Identity
- Statement	of	educational	purpose	(SEP)

## V54Aggregate	Verification	Group

This	group	is	essentially	a	combination	of	V1	and	V4.	Tax	filers	and	non-tax	filers	must	verify	the	items	listed	in	the Standard	Verification	Group	(V1).	Students	must	also	verify	their	identity	and	sign	a	statement	of	educational	purpose.

## Changing	Tracking	Groups

A	student	may	move	from	Verification	Tracking	Group	V1	or	V4	to	group	V5	based	on	corrections	made	to	their	FPS	record or	on	other	information	available	to	the	Department.	If	verification	was	already	completed	for	the	previous	group,	the student	is	only	required	to	verify	the	V5	information	that	was	not	already	verified.	If	verification	was	not	completed	for	the previous	group,	the	student	needs	to	verify	all	the	V5	information.

No	disbursements	of	Title	IV	aid	may	be	made	until	the	V5	verification	is	satisfactorily	completed.	If	the	student	doesn9t complete	verification,	the	school	is	not	liable	for	any	Title	IV	aid	it	disbursed	prior	to	receiving	the	group	V5	ISIR.	The student	is	liable	for	the	full	amount	because	without	verification	there	is	no	evidence	they	were	eligible	for	that	aid.	See the	October	31,	2016	Electronic	Announcement	for	more	information	about	disbursements	and	potential	return	of	funds when	students	are	selected	for	verification.

## Reporting	Results	for	Groups	V4	and	V5

Note: The	following	section	provides	guidance	based	on	the	assumption	that	the	Verification	of	Identity functionality	is	available	in	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(FPP).	However,	this	functionality	was	delayed	and	may	not be	available.	The	Department	provided	flexibility	to	report	any	V4	or	V5	initial	identity	outcomes	or	changes	within 60	days	or	30	days	respectively	of	the	normal	timeframe	requirement	or	when	the	FPP	Verification	of	Identity function	becomes	available,	whichever	is	later.	See	Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-24-63	for	additional information.

You	must	report	the	verification	results	of	identity	for	any	student	for	whom	you	(1)	receive	an	ISIR	with	tracking	flag	V4 or	V54 as	selected	by	the	FPS,	not	your	school 4and	(2)	request	verification	documentation.

You	are	required	to	report	results no	more	than	60	days following	your	first	request	to	the	student	for	documentation	of identity.	Inaccurate	and	untimely	reporting	may	subject	your	school	to	findings	on	your	annual	compliance	audit	or	a program	review.	If	there	is	a	change	in	a	result	you	have	already	submitted,	you	can	submit	the	new	code	using	the above	process	and	must	make	that	change within	30	days of	becoming	aware	that	a	change	occurred.	The	most	recent submission	will	supplant	prior	award	year	submissions.

## Individual	Reporting

When	the	Verification	of	Identity	function	is	available	in	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	(FPP),	you	will	see	a	list	of	applications who	were	selected	for	either	V4	or	V5	identity	verification	who	also	listed	your	school	on	their	FAFSA	form.	You	can	filter the	list	by	Name	or	SSN	or	sort	the	records	alphabetically,	in	ascending	or	descending	order.	You	can	select	from	the following	dropdown	options:

- Display	all	3	Default	option;
- Display	not	submitted	3	Displays	only	applicants	for	whom	no	results	have	been	provided;	or
- Display	submitted	3	Displays	only	the	applicants	for	whom	results	have	been	provided.

For	the	2025-26	award	year,	you	will	then	enter	one	of	the	following	numeric	codes	that	most	applies:

- 1-Verification	completed	in	person,	no	issues	found
- 2-Verification	completed	remotely,	no	issues	found
- 3-Verification	attempted,	issues	found	with	identity.	(You	did	not	receive	acceptable	documentation	for	the	SEP	or identity.)
- 5-No	response	from	applicant	or	unable	to	locate

Note: Numeric	codes	4	and	6	are	reserved	by	the	Department	for	future	use.

## Batch	Reporting

Batch	reporting	may	not	be	available	at	the	time	you	are	required	to	begin	reporting	identity	verification	for	the	2025-26 award	year.	However,	these	instructions	are	provided	for	future	use	when	this	functionality	becomes	available.

You	can	submit	verification	results	by	uploading	a	.CSV	file	with	the	data	for	up	to	2,000	students.	Each	row	must	contain only	one	record	and	have	the	following	elements,	each	in	their	own	column:

- Applicant9s	nine-digit	Social	Security	number;
- Last	name;	and
- Verification	of	identity	result	numeric	code	from	above.

## Verification	Exclusions

There	are	times	when	you	don9t	need	to	verify	a	student9s	application.	You	are,	however,	still	required	to	resolve conflicting	information	(except	when	a	student	dies	during	the	award	year	or	when	they	are	no	longer	enrolled	and	will not	re-enroll;	see	Chapter	5).	You	must	document	the	basis	for	the	verification	exclusion.	Other	information	not	excluded must	still	be	verified	according	to	all	other	requirements.

You	don9t	have	to	verify	FAFSA	information	of	a	student	in	the	following	situations:

- Death	of	the	student. You	don9t	have	to	continue	verification	if	you	made	an	interim	disbursement	and	the	student died	before	verification	was	completed.	You	cannot	make	any	additional	disbursements,	except	for	FWS	funds already	earned,	to	any	of	the	student9s	beneficiaries.	You	cannot	originate	or	disburse	their	Direct	Subsidized	Loan. Further,	you	cannot	consider	any	interim	disbursement	you	made	of	Pell	or	FSEOG	funds	or	provisional	FWS employment	to	be	an	overpayment.
- Not	an	aid	recipient. The	student	won9t	receive	Title	IV	aid	for	reasons	other	than	a	failure	to	complete	verification. This	includes	being	ineligible	for	that	aid	and	withdrawing	without	receiving	it.
- The	applicant	is	eligible	to	receive	only	unsubsidized	student	financial	assistance. However,	students selected	for	V4	or	V5	verification	should	complete	it	in	accordance	with	the	answer	to	DOC-Q18	on	the	Program Integrity	Questions	and	Answers	3	Verification	page.
- Applicant	verified	by	another	school. The	student	completed	verification	for	the	current	award	year	at	another school	before	transferring.	Their	FAFSA	data	must	be	the	same	as	it	was	at	the	previous	school,	and	you	must	get	a letter	from	that	school	stating	that	it	verified	the	student's	application	and	providing	the	transaction	number	of	the pertinent	valid	ISIR.
- Post	enrollment. The	student	was	selected	for	verification after ceasing	to	be	enrolled	at	your	school,	they	do	not intend	to	reenroll	for	the	award	year,	and	no	further	(including	late)	disbursements	will	be	made.

Unless	you	have	reason	to	believe	it	is	inaccurate,	you	don9t	have	to	verify	the	reported	FAFSA	information	of	the parents of	a	dependent	student if	any	of	the	following	apply	(including	in	cases	where	there	is	only	one	parent):

- Both	parents	are	mentally	incapacitated.
- Both	parents,	or	the	custodial	parent,	has	died.
- The	parents	are	residing	in	a	country	other	than	the	United	States	and	can9t	be	contacted	by	normal	means.
- The	parents	can9t	be	located	because	the	student	does	not	have	and	cannot	get	their	contact	information.

Unless	you	have	reason	to	believe	it	is	inaccurate,	you	don9t	have	to	verify	the	reported	FAFSA	information	of	the spouse of	an	independent	student if	any	of	the	following	apply:

- The	spouse	has	died.
- The	spouse	is	mentally	incapacitated.
- The	spouse	is	residing	in	a	country	other	than	the	United	States	and	can9t	be	contacted	by	normal	means.
- The	spouse	can9t	be	located	because	the	student	does	not	have	and	cannot	get	their	contact	information.

## Verification	Exemption	Example

AVG,	Chapter	4,	Example	1: A	student	is	enrolled	in	their	local	community	college	and	their	application	is selected	for	verification.	The	student	provides	their	spouse9s	information	on	the	application	but	now	explains	that the	spouse	recently	moved	out	and	is	unreachable.	The	student	provides	their	school	documents	to	show	that they	tried	to	locate	their	estranged	spouse.	The	school	determines	that	the	student	doesn9t	need	to	verify	their spouse9s	tax	and	income	information.	However,	the	student	must	still	verify	their	own	information.	The	school may	also	choose	to	use	professional	judgment	to	remove	the	spouse9s	information	from	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.

## Verification	Exclusions

## 34	CFR	668.54(b)

## Verification	Following	Disasters

The	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-17-08	gives	general	guidance	for	awarding	aid	in	federally	declared	disasters.	It	states that	the	Secretary	will	not	enforce	the	verification	requirements	during	the	award	year	for	applicants	whose	records	were lost	or	destroyed	because	of	a	disaster	if	the	school	has	tried	to	preserve	and	reconstruct	any	records.	The	school	must document	when	it	does	not	perform	verification	for	this	reason	and	use	status	code	&lt;S=	when	reporting	the	disbursement of	Pell	Grants	to	affected	students.	Also,	the	requirement	for	dependent	students	to	submit	a	statement	signed	by	a parent	regarding	family	size	is	waived	if	the	parents	cannot	provide	the	signature	due	to	the	disaster.	The	school	must note	why	no	parent	was	able	to	provide	the	statement.

Schools	that	experience	a	local	disaster	(rather	than	a	federally	declared	one)	that	affects	Title	IV	administration	should consult	their	regional	school	participation	division.

## Acceptable	Documentation

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	requires	that,	wherever	possible,	the	Department	use	data	received	directly	from	the	IRS	to calculate	a	student9s	SAI	and	Pell	Grant	award.	The	Fostering	Undergraduate	Talent	by	Unlocking	Resources	for	Education Act	(FUTURE	Act)	requires	the	Department	of	Education	to	access	tax	information	held	by	the	IRS	pertaining	to	FAFSA applicants4and,	where	applicable,	their	parents	and	spouses4through	a	secure	method:	the	FUTURE	Act	Direct	Data Exchange	(FA-DDX).	The	FUTURE	Act	amended	the	Internal	Revenue	Code	(IRC)	to	mandate	the	disclosure	of	FTI	directly from	the	IRS	to	the	Department	with	an	individual9s	consent	and	approval.	The	FUTURE	Act	also	made	providing	consent and	approval	for	the	exchange	of	FTI	a	requirement	for	receiving	federal	student	aid.

Applicants	and	contributors	will	be	required	to	provide	consent	and	approval	to	retrieve	FTI	directly	from	the	IRS.	When FTI	is	received	from	the	IRS	via	the	FA-DDX,	the	FTI	received	is	considered	verified	and	no	additional	documentation	is necessary.	As	a	result,	the	FA-DDX	is	the	fastest,	easiest,	and	most	secure	method	of	meeting	income	and	tax	verification requirements.	The	September	4,	2024	Federal	Register	Notice	gives	the	documentation	required	for	verifying	2025-26 application	data,	which	depends	on	the	item	verified,	as	explained	in	this	section.

If	you	use	a	verification	document,	be	sure	that	it	is	signed,	that	all	required	sections	are	completed,	and	that	any relevant	tax	or	alternative	documents	are	attached.	Copies	of	original	documents	are	acceptable.	An	original	signature	on an	original	document,	an	original	signature	on	a	copy	of	a	document,	and	a	copy	of	a	document	with	an	original	signature on	it	are	all	valid	signatures,	unless	specifically	noted	in	this	chapter.	If	a	copy	of	the	tax	return	is	used,	the	filer	(or	at least	one	of	the	filers	of	a	joint	return)	must	sign	it	or	the	tax	preparer	must	provide	their	name	and	SSN,	EIN,	or	PTIN.

## Suggested	Verification	Text

The	Department	has	developed	suggested	text	that	you	may	use	to	create	a	verification	document	and	to	verify	non-tax items,	such	as	family	size.	To	review	the	suggested	text	for	2025-26,	please	see	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-24-10.	The suggested	text	fulfills	verification	requirements,	but	schools	do	not	have	to	use	it,	except	as	noted	below.	Instead,	they may	develop	and	use	their	own	(or	someone	else9s)	text,	forms,	documents,	statements,	and	certifications	that	are specific	to	the	items	required	to	be	verified	for	a	particular	student	or	group	of	students	at	the	school.	However,	schools must	not	put	the	seal	of	the	Department	of	Education	on	any	verification	documents.

The	one	exception	is	that	schools	must	use	the	exact	language	provided	in	the	&lt;Statement	of	Educational	Purpose=	for students	who	are	placed	in	verification	tracking	groups	V4	or	V5.	This	does	not	include	the	accompanying	notary9s certificate	of	acknowledgment;	for	that	the	school	may	use	some	other	form,	such	as	the	one	its	state	uses.

## Income	Information	for	Tax	Filers

As	already	noted,	the	importation	of	IRS	tax	data	(FTI)	via	the	FA-DDX	serves	as	verification	documentation.	Applicants and	contributors	will	not	see	or	be	given	the	option	to	change	FTI	imported	directly	from	the	IRS	via	the	FA-DDX.	Data transferred	in	this	manner	is	considered	verified,	but	there	may	be	other	data	elements	that	must	still	be	verified	with additional	documentation.

When information is not transferred from the IRS, and for item (i), the following documentation is sufficient for verification: (1) A transcript obtained at no cost from the IRS or other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory (Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands) or commonwealth (Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands), or a foreign government, that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer; or (2) A signed copy of the income tax return)and the applicable schedules that were filed with the IRS or other relevant tax authority of a U.S. territory, or a foreign government that lists 2023 tax account information of the tax filer. (3) If item (d) or (e) contains a rollover, a signed statement confirming the amount of the rollover in the untaxed pension or IRA distribution. Note that even if (d) or (e) are transferred as FTI, rollovers still need to be verified as they are manually entered. |

Qualified	rollovers	from	one	retirement	account	to	another	are	not	taxable,	and	they	should	not	be	counted	as	untaxed income	(Untaxed	portions	of	IRA	distributions	(d)	or	Pensions	(e)	above).	Since	neither	a	tax	transcript	nor	FTI	transferred via	the	FA-DDX	identifies	rollovers,	you	must	get	documentation	from	the	tax	filer.	This	could	be	a	signed	statement	with the	rollover	amount	or	a	notation	by	the	filer	on	the	tax	transcript	or	return	that	includes	the	word	&lt;rollover=	beside	any applicable	item,	like	the	instruction	the	IRS	gives	for	Form	1040.	The	annotation	must	be	signed	and	dated	by	the	filer. See	VI-Q4	on	the	Program	Integrity	Questions	and	Answers	3	Verification.

| Income Earned from Work | For an individual who has not filed and, under IRS or other relevant tax authority rules (e.g., the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, a U.S. territory or commonwealth or a foreign government), is not required to file a 2023 income tax return4 (1) A signed and dated statement certifying4 a. That the individual is not required to file a 2023 income tax return; and b. The sources and amounts of earnings, other income, and resources that supported the individual(s) for the 2023 tax year; (2) For individuals without a Social Security number (SSN), Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), or Employer Identification Number (EIN), that they do not have an SSN, ITIN, or EIN; (3) A copy of IRS Form W-2 for each source of 2023 employment income received or an equivalent document; and (4) Except for dependent students , verification of non-filing)for individuals who would file a return with a relevant tax authority other than the IRS dated on or after October 1, 2024. |

For	non-tax	filers/you	must	request	a	W-2	form	for	each	source	of	2023	employment	income	and	a	signed	statement certifying	that	the	person	has	not	filed	and	is	not	required	to	file	a	2023	tax	return.	You	must	also	get	a	signed	statement giving	the	sources	and	amounts	of	the	person9s	income	earned	from	work	not	found	on	W-2s.	Students	may	sign	on	a nonfiling	spouse9s	behalf.

For	residents	of	the	Freely	Associated	States,	a	copy	of	the	wage	and	tax	statement	from	each	employer	(substitute	for	W2s)	and	a	signed	statement	identifying	any	other	employment	income	for	the	year	not	identified	on	the	wage	and	tax statement	is	acceptable.	Persons	from	a	U.S.	territory,	commonwealth,	or	a	foreign	country	who	are	not	required	to	file	a tax	return	can	provide	a	signed	statement,	as	well	as	any	supporting	documentation	they	might	have	(e.g.,	a	form comparable	to	a	U.S.	W-2),	certifying	their	income.

The	collection	of	documentation	to	verify	income	earned	from	work	is	used	to	determine	if	the	applicant	(and	the applicable	spouse	or	parent)	was	required	to	file	a	U.S.	income	tax	return	(or	a	return	with	a	relevant	tax	authority)	for	the 2023	tax	year.	If	the	individual	should	have	filed	but	failed	to	do	so,	that	is	conflicting	information	that	you	must	resolve.

## If	a	W-2	is	not	Available

If	an	individual	who	is	required	to	submit	an	IRS	Form	W-2	did	not	save	a	copy,	they	should	request	a	replacement	W-2 from	the	employer	who	issued	the	original.	A	W-2	transcript	from	the	IRS	is	also	acceptable	though	it	generally	is	not available	until	the	year	after	the	W-2	information	is	filed	with	the	IRS	(e.g.,	2025	for	2023	information	filed	in	2024).	If they	are	unable	to	obtain	one	in	a	timely	manner,	you	may	permit	them	to	provide	a	signed	statement	that	includes	the amount	of	income	earned	from	work,	the	source	of	that	income,	and	the	reason	why	the	W-2	is	not	available	in	a	timely manner.

## Family	Size

Since	family	size	is	based	on	the	number	of	individuals	listed	and	claimed	on	the	IRS	tax	return,	if	transferred	directly from	the	IRS	and	used,	family	size	does	not	need	to	be	verified.	However,	when	information	is	not	transferred	from	the IRS,	or	if	the	applicant	updated	their	family	size	when	presented	with	the	opportunity	to	do	so	on	their	FAFSA,	the following	documentation	is	sufficient	for	verification:

- A	statement	signed	by	the	applicant	and,	if	the	applicant	is	a	dependent	student,	by	one	of	the	applicant's	parents, that	lists	the	name	and	age	of	each	family	member	for	the	2025326	award	year	and	the	relationship	of	that	family member	to	the	applicant.

## Family	Size	Documentation

## 34	CFR	668.57(b)

For	a	dependent	student,	you	don9t	have	to	verify	family	size	in	the	following	situations:

- The	family	size	is	reported	as	two	with	a	single,	divorced,	separated,	or	widowed	parent;	or
- The	family	size	is	reported	as	three	with	parents	who	are	married	or	are	unmarried	and	living	together.

For	an	independent	student,	you	don9t	have	to	verify	family	size	in	the	following	situations:

- The	family	size	is	reported	as	two	if	the	student	is	married;	or
- The	family	size	is	reported	as	one	if	the	student	is	single,	divorced,	separated,	or	widowed.

Additionally,	you	don9t	need	to	verify	family	size	if	the	applicant	manually	updated	their	family	size	and	the	number	is	the same	as	the	family	size	derived	from	data	transferred	directly	from	the	IRS.

Keep	in	mind	that	family	size	needs	to	align	with	the	answers	to	the	relevant	dependency	status	questions,	such	as	the one	about	having	dependents	other	than	a	spouse.	If	verification	reveals	that	answers	do	not	match,	the	FAFSA	form needs	to	be	corrected	so	that	the	information	is	in	alignment.

## Identity	and	Statement	of	Educational	Purpose

Students	should	appear	in	person	at	your	school	and	present	a	valid,	unexpired,	government-issued	photo	identification (ID)	such	as	a	U.S.	passport,	a	driver9s	license,	or	other	state-issued	ID.	&lt;Unexpired=	means	the	ID	has	not	expired	at	the time	it	is	checked,	even	if	it	will	expire	before	the	end	of	the	award	year.	A	valid	government-issued	photo	identification	is one	issued	by	the	U.S.	government,	any	of	the	50	States,	the	District	of	Columbia,	the	Commonwealth	of	Puerto	Rico,	a federally	recognized	American	Indian	and	Alaska	Native	Tribe,	American	Samoa,	Guam,	the	Virgin	Islands,	the Commonwealth	of	the	Northern	Mariana	Islands,	the	Republic	of	the	Marshall	Islands,	the	Federated	States	of	Micronesia, or	the	Republic	of	Palau.

You	must	maintain	an	annotated	copy	of	that	ID	that	includes	the	date	it	was	received	and	the	name	of	the	person	your school	authorized	to	receive	it.	Your	school	may	determine	which	of	its	staff	are	authorized	to	review	an	applicant9s identity.	We	recommend	that	the	person(s)	be	full-time	staff	and	the	school	keep	a	record	of	who	they	are.

The	following are	not	sufficient for	identity	verification:

- An	ID	issued	by	a	state	university	or	college.
- A	military	ID	(18	U.S.	Code	§	701	prohibits	it	from	being	photocopied).

Students	must	also	sign	(it	must	be	a	&lt;wet=	signature)	a	statement	of	educational	purpose	that	certifies	who	they	are	and that	the	federal	student	aid	they	may	receive	will	only	be	used	for	educational	purposes	and	for	the	cost	of	attending	the school	for	the	2025-26	year.	Unlike	the	other	suggested	text	provided	in	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-24-10	the	text	for	the &lt;Statement	of	Educational	Purpose=	is	not	suggested4 you	must	use	the	exact	language	given (though	the	student9s identification	number	is	optional	if	collected	elsewhere	on	the	same	page	as	the	statement).	After	examining	the statement,	you	may	convert	it	into	an	electronic	record.	You	must	keep	that	or	the	original	for	at	least	the	required	Title	IV record	retention	period.

A	student	who	is	unable	to	appear	at	your	school	must	go	to	a	notary	public	and	sign	the	statement	of	educational purpose	(see	&lt;Verification	for	Confined	or	Incarcerated	Individuals=	for	an	exception	to	this	requirement).	They	must submit	to	your	office	that	signed	statement	(again,	with	the	&lt;wet=	signature),	a	certification	from	the	notary	that	they appeared	before	the	notary	and	presented	a	government-issued	photo	ID	confirming	their	identity,	and	a	copy	of	the same	ID.	Currently	the	Department	does	not	authorize	the	use	of	online	notary	services	as	an	alternative	to	traditional,	inperson	notary	services.

The REAL	ID	Act affects	people	entering	certain	restricted	areas	where	identification	is	required:	federal	facilities, nuclear	power	plants,	and	federally	regulated	commercial	airplanes.	Because	there	are	currently	no	restrictions	under	the act	on	agencies	accepting	an	ID	that	is	not	compliant	with	the	act	(typically	one	marked	&lt;not	for	federal	identification=) for	other	purposes,	such	an	ID	is	acceptable	for	verification	of	identity/statement	of	educational	purpose.	It	must	be	a government-issued	ID	that	has	not	expired	and	includes	the	student9s	photo	and	name.

## Reviewing	and	Using	Documentation

## Using	the	Tax	Return

Although	FTI	transferred	via	the	FA-DDX	or	an	IRS	tax	transcript	are	preferable	for	completing	verification,	students	can also	submit	a	copy	of	the	tax	return	and	any	applicable	schedules.	However,	see	the	guidance	under	&lt;victims	of	identity theft=	later	in	this	volume	for	an	important	caveat.	The	tax	return	will	likely	have	been	filed	electronically	with	one	of	a variety	of	methods.	These	include	do-it-yourself	methods	as	well	as	completion	by	a	tax	preparer.	Each	method	should permit	printing	of	a	paper	copy	of	the	return,	though	the	e-file	format	might	not	contain	every	line	item,	showing	instead only	the	data	the	tax	filer	provided.	For	example,	if	Item	2b,	&lt;Taxable	interest,=	does	not	appear	on	such	a	return,	that means	no	taxable	interest	income	was	reported.

You	can	accept	a	paper	or	electronic	copy	of	the	return	if	it	contains	a	signature.	Acceptable	examples	would	include,	but are	not	limited	to:

- A	signed	paper	return	that	the	student	either	mailed	or	brought	to	the	school.
- A	signed	paper	return	that	the	student	faxed	or	scanned	and	emailed.
- An	electronic	copy	that	the	student	signed	with	a	stylus	or	finger.
- An	electronic	copy	that	we	consider	signed	because	it	has	an	image	of	the	student9s	signature	attached.

However,	a	signature	on	Form	8879,	the	IRS	e-file	Signature	Authorization,	is	not	an	acceptable	substitute	for	a	signature on	the	tax	return.

For	persons	who	have	a	tax	professional	prepare	their	return,	instead	of	a	copy	of	the	return	with	the	filer9s	signature,	you may	accept	one	that	has	the	name	and	PTIN	of	the	preparer	or	has	their	SSN	or	EIN	and	has	been	signed,	stamped,	typed, or	printed	with	their	name	and	address.	Note	that	the	IRS	requires	paid	preparers	to	have	a	PTIN.

If	a	person	did	not	retain	a	copy	of	their	2023	tax	information	and	it	cannot	be	located	by	the	IRS	or	the	relevant government	agency,	they	must	submit	a	signed	statement	indicating	that	they	did	not	keep	a	copy	of	their	tax information	as	well	as	documentation	from	the	taxing	authority	indicating	that	the	information	cannot	be	located.	Also, you	must	accept	for	an	IRS	filer	either	a	copy	of	Form	W32	for	each	source	of	employment	income	received	for	2023	or,	if they	are	self-employed,	a	signed	statement	certifying	the	amount	of	AGI	and	taxes	paid.	For	someone	who	filed	an income	tax	return	with	a	government	of	a	U.S.	territory	or	commonwealth	or	a	foreign	central	government,	accept	a	copy of	a	wage	and	tax	statement	or	a	signed	statement	certifying	the	amount	of	AGI	and	taxes	paid	for	2023.

The	following	chart	shows	the	tax	form	line	numbers	for	the	required	verification	items	from	IRS	Form	1040	(or	IRS	Form 1040-NR).

* Note:	Negative	values	should	be	set	to	zero	when	calculating	Income	Earned	from	Work.	For	example,	if	IRS	Form	1040, line	1z	is	$50,000	and	Schedule	1,	line	3	is	-$10,000,	the	income	earned	from	work	value	should	be	$50,000.

## Using	the	Tax	Transcript

If	applicants	or	contributors	are	unable	to	transfer	data	via	the	FA-DDX,	the	student,	spouse,	and/or	parents,	as applicable,	can	use	an	IRS	tax	return	transcript	to	document	information	from	the	tax	return.	Before	requesting	a transcript,	they	should	allow	enough	time	to	pass	after	filing	the	return;	it	takes	the	IRS	two	to	four	weeks	to	process returns	filed	electronically	and	six	to	eight	weeks	for	mailed	returns.	Tax	transcripts	submitted	to	your	school	for verification	do	not	need	to	be	signed	by	the	tax	filer	(but	it	is	encouraged)	unless	you	have	reason	to	doubt	their authenticity.

There	are	a	few	ways	to	request	a	tax	return	transcript.	The	IRS	provides	instructions	on	all	options	at www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript.	Per	the	IRS,	the	fastest	and	easiest	way	is	to	access	personal	tax	records	online, which	allows	the	tax	filer	to	get	a	real-time,	electronic	transcript.	Tax	filers	who	opt	to	request	transcripts	by	mail	or phone	will	receive	a	mailed	transcript	in	return.	Schools	can	accept	and	copy	transcripts	originally	obtained	from	the	IRS.

The	IRS9s	Income	Verification	Express	Service	(IVES)	allows	a	third	party	to	request	and	receive	a	tax	filer9s	transcript.	The IVES	participant	submits	a	4506-C	form,	signed	by	the	tax	filer,	and	receives	the	transcript	from	the	IRS,	which	charges	a small	fee	for	the	service.	Schools	may	apply	to	participate	in	IVES.	They	may	also	use	a	transcript	from	another	IVES participant	(which	is	not	considered	a	third-party	servicer	in	this	case)	for	verification	if	they	have	no	reason	to	doubt	its authenticity.	Schools	may	not	pass	on	the	charge	for	using	this	service	to	the	student.

To	combat	identity	theft,	the	IRS	masks	much	of	the	personally	identifiable	information	on	the	transcript.	For	example, only	the	last	four	digits	of	any	SSN	or	account	or	telephone	number	are	displayed.	When	requesting	a	transcript, taxpayers	will	be	prompted	to	create	a	&lt;customer	file	number=	which	appears	on	a	requested	transcript	to	help	facilitate identification.	This	can	be	something	like	a	student9s	college	ID	number	or	some	other	number	(but not an	SSN).	See	the October	4,	2018,	announcement	and	the	IRS	news	release	for	more	information.

Each	year	the	Department	provides	a	tax	return	transcript	matrix	to	assist	schools	with	reviewing	tax	data.	Specifically, the tax	return	transcript	matrix consists	of	a	chart	of	the	FAFSA	and	ISIR	tax	items	used	for	verification	and	their corresponding	line	items	from	the	various	IRS	tax	returns	and	the	tax	transcript	for	the	appropriate	award	year.	At	the time	the	2025-26	Application	and	Verification	Guide	was	published,	the	2023	tax	return	transcript	matrix	had	not	been posted	to	FSA9s	Knowledge	Center.	Please	stay	tuned	to	the	electronic	announcement	section	in	the	Knowledge	Center	for the	latest	information.

The	tax	return	transcript	may	show	a per	computer	amount for	some	tax	data	that	is	different	from	what	the	filer reported	to	the	IRS.	The	per	computer	amount	should	be	used	because	it	corrects	mathematical	errors	and	is	more accurate	than	what	appears	on	the	original	return.	Also,	if	a	transcript	indicates	&lt;recomputed	&lt;tax	return	item&gt;	per computer,=	that	amount	may	be	ignored	for	verification.

Schools	may	accept	for	verification	any	IRS	tax	transcript	that	includes	all	the	necessary	information:	adjusted	gross income,	income	earned	from	work,	U.S.	income	tax	paid,	untaxed	IRA	distributions,	untaxed	pensions,	education	credits, IRA	deductions,	tax	exempt	interest,	and	foreign	income	exempt	from	federal	taxation.	Because	the	&lt;record	of	account transcript=	and	the	&lt;tax	return	transcript=	include	all	the	above	information,	either	may	be	used	for	verification.	The &lt;wage	and	income	transcript=	only	provides	wage	information	and	therefore	can	only	be	used	in	lieu	of	a	W-2	form.

## Using	the	Tax	Transcript

## February	23,	2017	Electronic	Announcement

IRS	Transcript	types

Filers	of	non-IRS	tax	returns. You	may	accept	a	transcript	from	a	government	of	a	foreign	nation	or	a	U.S.	territory	or commonwealth	that	has	all	the	filer9s	income	and	tax	data	to	be	verified.	You	may	also	accept	a	copy	of	the	tax	return, which	must	be	signed	by	the	filer	or	one	of	the	filers	of	a	joint	return.	Use	the	income	and	tax	data	that	most	closely corresponds	to	what	is	on	the	IRS	tax	return	and	convert	monetary	amounts	into	U.S.	dollars	as	appropriate.	If	you question	the	accuracy	of	the	information	on	the	signed	copy	of	the	return,	the	filer	must	provide	you	with	a	copy	of	the tax	account	information	issued	by	the	tax	authority.	See	DOC-Q28	on	the	Program	Integrity	Questions	and	Answers	3 Verification.

## Unique	Situations	and	Exceptions

## Joint	Return	Filers	Who	Are	No	Longer	Married

When	a	student,	or	parents	of	a	dependent	student,	filed	a	joint	return	and	have	separated,	divorced,	married	someone else,	or	been	widowed,	the	student	must	submit	the	following:

- A	transcript	obtained	from	the	IRS	or	other	relevant	tax	authority	that	lists	2023	tax	account	information	of	the	tax filer(s); or
- A	copy	of	the	income	tax	return	and	the	applicable	schedules	that	were	filed	with	the	IRS	or	other	relevant	tax authority	that	lists	2023	tax	account	information	of	the	tax	filer(s); and
- A	copy	of	IRS	Form	W-2	for	each	source	of	2023	employment	income	received	or	an	equivalent	document.

## Using	a	Joint	Return	to	Figure	Individual	AGI	and	Taxes	Paid

If	the	filer	of	a	joint	return	has	become	widowed,	divorced,	or	separated	since	filing	the	return,	it	may	be	necessary	to determine	the	individual9s	income	and	taxes	paid	using	the	joint	return	and	W-2	forms.	If	a	W-2	is	not	available	(the	filer	is self-employed,	for	example)	or	if	a	duplicate	copy	from	the	employer	who	issued	the	original	W-2	is	not	available	in	a timely	manner,	the	school	may	permit	the	filer	to	provide	a	signed	statement	that	certifies	the	base	year	AGI	and	U.S. taxes	paid.

Add	the	income	amounts	from	the	individual9s	W-2	forms	to	any	other	income	that	can	be	extracted	from	the	joint	return. Any	interest	or	business	income	earned	on	joint	accounts	or	investments	should	be	assessed	at	50%.	The	same	procedure should	be	used	to	divide	business	or	farm	profits	or	losses.	Also,	if	the	AGI	listed	on	the	joint	return	was	adjusted,	you should	reduce	the	individual9s	AGI	by	the	portion	of	the	adjustment	that	applies	solely	to	individual	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Use	one	of	the	following	methods	to	figure	the	individual9s	taxes	paid:

- Tax	table	(preferred	method). Using	the	IRS	Tax	Table	or	Tax	Rate	Schedule	for	the	appropriate	year,	calculate the	amount	of	tax	that	would	have	been	paid	if	a	separate	return	had	been	filed.	Use	the	deductions	the	individual could	have	claimed	if	the	individual	had	filed	a	separate	return.	(If	itemized	deductions	were	taken,	count	only	the portion	of	those	deductions	that	could	have	been	claimed	on	a	separate	tax	return.)
- Proportional	distribution. Determine	what	percentage	of	the	joint	AGI	was	attributable	to	the	individual,	and	then assess	the	joint	taxes	paid	by	that	same	percentage.

## Separating	a	Joint	Return	Example

AVG,	Chapter	4,	Example	2: A	student9s	application	is	selected	for	verification.	The	student	filed	joint	return with	their	spouse	in	2023	but	have	now	divorced.	The	AGI	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	matches	the	AGI	of	$56,500	on the	2023	tax	return,	which	means	it9s	wrong	because	it	includes	the	student9s	former	spouse's	income.

The	student9s	W-2	shows	that	their	income	for	2023	was	$25,900,	and	the	tax	return	shows	$400	in	interest. Because	it	was	interest	on	a	joint	savings	account,	the	aid	administrator	adds	$200	of	it	to	the	student9s	income and	submits	$26,100	as	the	corrected	income.

The	aid	administrator	then	determines	that	if	the	student	had	filed	their	tax	return	as	single	in	2023,	their standard	deduction	would	have	been	$13,850	(instead	of	$27,700	for	married	filers).	The	student9s	income	of $26,100	minus	$13,850	for	the	standard	deduction	results	in	$12,250	in	taxable	income.

The	aid	administrator	uses	the	2023	tax	table	to	determine	how	much	tax	the	student	would	have	paid	on	this amount,	considering	any	applicable	credits	reported	on	the	original	return.	With	a	taxable	income	of	$12,250,	the tax	amount	from	the	tax	schedule	is	$1,253.

To	use	the	proportional	distribution	method	instead,	the	aid	administrator	figures	out	what	percentage	of	the	joint AGI	student9s	income	represents.	The	percentage	is	46%	(26,100	÷	56,500	is	.4619).	The	aid	administrator	then multiplies	the	income	tax	paid	as	reported	on	the	tax	return	($3,019	for	this	example)	by	this	percentage.	The student9s	income	tax	by	using	this	method	is	$1,394	(.46	x	$3,019).

## Individuals	With	Filing	Extensions

The	IRS	may	grant	a	filing	extension	(beyond	the	automatic	six-month	extension)	to	an	individual	required	to	file	a	2023 IRS	income	tax	return.	For	an	individual	who	receives	such	a	filing	extension,	the	student	must	submit	the	following:

- A	signed	statement	listing	the	sources	of	any	2023	income	and	the	amount	of	income	from	each	source;
- A	copy	of	the	IRS's	approval	of	an	extension	beyond	the	automatic	six-month	extension	for	tax	year	2023;)
- A	copy	of	IRS	Form	W-2	for	each	source	of	2023	employment	income	received	or	an	equivalent	document;	and
- If	self-employed,	the	signed	statement	must	indicate	the	amount	of	estimated	AGI	and	U.S.	income	tax	paid	for	tax year	2023.

You	may	require	individuals	with	a	filing	extension	to	provide	final	income	information	to	you	after	the	return	has	been filed.	If	you	do	that,	you	must	reverify	the	income	information.	If	the	student	does	not	provide	final	income	information, see	the	guidance	described	under	the	&lt;Deadlines	and	Failure	to	Submit	Documentation=	section	later	in	this	chapter	on failing	to	complete	verification.	See	DOC-Q16	on	the	Program	Integrity	Questions	and	Answers	3	Verification.

For	a	person	called	up	for	active	duty	or	qualifying	National	Guard	duty	during	a	war,	another	military	operation,	or	a national	emergency,	a	school	must	accept	a	statement	from	the	person	certifying	that	they	have	not	filed	an	income	tax return	or	a	request	for	a	filing	extension	because	of	that	service.

## Filers	of	Amended	Returns

Students	or	parents	who	file	an	amended	return	(IRS	Form	1040X)	and	provide	consent	and	approval	to	retrieve	FTI	via the	FA-DDX	will not have	their	amended	information	transferred	to	the	FAFSA	form.	The	IRS	will	transfer	only	original	tax information	to	the	FAFSA	form	via	the	FA-DDX.	However,	there	is	currently	no	indicator	on	the	FAFSA	form	that	the	tax return	was	amended	and	the	original	data	may	be	inaccurate.	If	you	are	aware	that	an	applicant	or	contributor	filed	an amended	return,	you	must	update	or	correct	the	applicant9s	FAFSA	form.	You	must	also	check	the	PJ	flag	on	the	corrected ISIR	transaction	so	that	FPS	recalculates	the	student9s	SAI	and	Pell	Grant	eligibility	using	the	manually	entered	tax information	(instead	of	the	FTI	received	via	the	FA-DDX).

If	the	applicant	is	selected	for	verification	and	you	are	aware	that	the	applicant	or	a	contributor	has	filed	an	amended return,	you	must	use	the	amended	return	information	to	complete	verification.	However,	if	you	were	not	previously	aware that	an	applicant	or	contributor	filed	an	amended	return,	you	are	not	required	to	confirm	whether	an	amended	return	was filed	as	part	of	the	verification	process.	You	may	still	consider	the	FTI	transferred	from	the	IRS	to	be	verified	if	you	have	no reason	to	believe	the	applicant	or	a	contributor	filed	an	amended	return.

Applicants	or	contributors	may	submit	a	signed	copy	of	the	filed	1040X	form	and	one	of	the	following	documents	to complete	verification:

- Income	and	tax	information	from	the	IRS	on	an	ISIR	record	with	all	tax	information	from	the	original	tax	return;
- A	transcript	obtained	from	the	IRS	that	lists	2023	tax	account	information	of	the	tax	filer(s);	or
- A	signed	copy	of	the	2023	IRS	Form	1040	and	the	applicable	schedules	that	were	filed	with	the	IRS.

Because	the	tax	return	transcript	does	not	reflect	changes	to	the	original	return	by	the	filer	or	the	IRS,	it	is,	by	itself,	not sufficient.

When	an	amended	return	was	filed,	you	must	submit	any	changes	to	nondollar	items	and	to	single	monetary	items	of	$25 or	more.

Note	that	there	may	be	instances	when	a	student,	spouse,	or	parent	did	not	file	a	1040X	with	the	IRS	but	had	their	tax and	income	information	amended	by	the	IRS.	In	such	a	case	a	school	may	accept	one	of	the	items	mentioned	above	plus documentation	showing	the	IRS9s	change(s).

## Victims	of	Tax-Related	Identity	Theft

Individuals	who	are	victims	of	tax-related	identity	theft	cannot	get	a	return	transcript	or	have	their	FTI	transferred	via	the FA-DDX.

In	the	past	we	have	requested	individuals	who	are	victims	of	IRS	tax-related	identity	theft	to	obtain	a	Tax	Return DataBase	View	(TRDBV)	transcript	from	the	IRS	for	verification	purposes.	However,	the	Department	is	aware	that	TRDBV transcript	requests	have	been	taking	over	a	year	to	process.	Due	to	the	long	processing	time,	we	will	instead	require individuals	who	are	victims	of	IRS	tax-related	identity	theft	to	provide	a	copy	of	the	following:

- A	signed	copy	of	the	2023	income	tax	return	and	applicable	schedules	the	individual	filed	with	the	IRS; and
- An	IRS	4674C	letter	(a	letter	from	the	IRS	acknowledging	the	identity	theft)	or	a	statement	signed	and	dated	by	the tax	filer	indicating	that	he	or	she	was	a	victim	of	IRS	tax-related	identity	theft,	and	the	IRS	is	aware	of	it.

This	change	to	required	documentation	was	provided	in	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-24-10.

## Verification	for	Confined	or	Incarcerated	Individuals

Confined	or	incarcerated	individuals	enrolled	in	approved	prison	education	programs	(PEPs)	are	eligible	for	Federal	Pell Grants.

For	the	2025-26	award	year,	a	confined	or	incarcerated	individual	as	indicated	through	the	incarcerated	applicant	flag	will only	be	required	to	verify	their	identity	and	statement	of	educational	purpose	if	selected	for	Verification	Tracking	Group V4	or	V5.	In	addition,	institutions	are	not	required	to	verify	a	confined	or	incarcerated	individual	selected	under Verification	Tracking	Flag	V1.

If	a	confined	or	incarcerated	student	is	unable	to	submit	a	signed	and	notarized	statement	of	educational	purpose,	a school	may	accept	a	signed	statement	from	an	authorized	official	who	works	for	the	correctional	facility	or	the	oversight entity	confirming	to	the	school	that	the	individual	who	completed	the	FAFSA	form	and	was	selected	for	verification	is	the person	signing	the	Statement	of	Educational	Purpose.

## Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-24-10

## Immigrants	and	Tax	Filing

Immigrants	are	not	exempt	from	tax	filing.	The	IRS	is	more	concerned	whether	a	person	is	a	resident	or	nonresident rather	than	a	legal	or	illegal	alien.	An	alien	is	anyone	who	is	not	a	U.S.	citizen	or	national.	A	resident	alien	is	one	who either	is	a	permanent	resident	or	has	resided	in	the	U.S.	for	a	specific	minimum	amount	of	time	(has	met	the	substantial presence	test).	All	others	are	nonresident	aliens.	Resident	aliens9	income	is	generally	subject	to	tax	in	the	same	manner as	U.S.	citizens9,	and	they	file	Form	1040.	Nonresident	aliens	who	are	required	to	file	a	return	submit	Form	1040NR,	which is	acceptable	documentation	for	verification.

Immigrants	who	do	not	have	an	SSN	and	are	unable	to	get	one	can	apply	with	the	IRS	for	an	individual	taxpayer identification	number	(ITIN).	The	ITIN	is	only	for	tax	purposes.	It	does	not	authorize	a	person	to	work,	endorse	his	or	her legal	status,	or	entitle	them	to	the	earned	income	credit	or	Social	Security	benefits.

See	the	IRS9s	Publication	519,	U.S.	Tax	Guide	for	Aliens	at	www.irs.gov	for	more	information.

## Interim	Disbursements

Interim	disbursements	are	allowed	either	prior	to	completing	verification	or	after	verification	but	before	receiving	the corrected	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR.	If	you	have	no	reason	to	question	the	accuracy	of	the	information	on	the FAFSA	form,	prior	to	completing	verification	you	may	at	your	discretion:

- Make	one	disbursement	of	Pell	and	FSEOG	funds	for	the	applicant9s	first	payment	period;
- Permit	FWS	employment	for	the	first	60	consecutive	days	after	the	student	enrolls	for	the	award	year;	or
- Originate	but	not	disburse	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan.

If	verification	results	in	changes	to	the	FAFSA	information	that	you	determine	will	not	alter	award	amounts,	you	may	at your	discretion	also	disburse	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	prior	to	receiving	the	corrected	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary or	ISIR	(defined	as	a	FAFSA	Submission	summary	or	ISIR	on	which	all	the	information	reported	on	a	student9s	FAFSA	form is	accurate	and	complete	as	of	the	date	the	application	is	signed).

## Interim	Disbursements

## 34	CFR	668.58

## Overpayments	From	Interim	Disbursements

If	you	make	an	interim	disbursement	of	Pell	or	FSEOG	funds	prior	to	verification	and	the	student9s	eligibility	for	Title	IV funds	changes	after	you	complete	verification,	your	school	is	liable	for	any	resulting	overpayment.	If	you	can9t	eliminate	it by	reducing	subsequent	disbursements	or	having	the	student	return	the	money,	your	school	must	use	its	own	funds	to reimburse	the	appropriate	program	by	the	earlier	of	60	days	after	the	student9s	last	day	of	attendance	or	the	last	day	of the	award	year.

If	your	school	permits	provisional	FWS	employment	of	students	for	up	to	60	days	prior	to	verification,	your	school	is	liable for	any	overpayment	it	can9t	recover	by	adjusting	other	aid,	and	it	must	reimburse	the	FWS	account	from	its	own	funds. Students	must	be	paid	for	all	work	performed	out	of	your	school9s	payroll	account4they	can9t	be	required	to	repay	FWS wages	earned	except	when	they	are	proven	guilty	of	fraud.

Because	the	school	made	interim	disbursements	at	its	discretion,	the	school	is	ultimately	responsible	for	repaying	any overpayment.	Therefore,	in	this	situation,	a	student	does	not	owe	a	Title	IV	overpayment	and	the	school	must	not	report an	overpayment	to	NSLDS	or	refer	it	to	the	Department	for	collection.

If	you	make	an	interim	disbursement	after	completing	verification	but	prior	to	receiving	a	correct	valid	FAFSA	Submission Summary	or	ISIR,	and	you	fail	to	receive	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	within	the	deadlines	discussed	later	in this	chapter,	your	school	must	use	its	own	funds	to	reimburse	the	appropriate	program	and	pay	the	student	under	your own	payroll	account	for	all	work	performed.

## Recovery	of	Funds	From	Interim	Disbursements

## 34	CFR	668.61

## Schools	that	Can9t	Make	Interim	Disbursements

Schools	on	the	Heightened	Cash	Monitoring	2	(HCM2)	and	Reimbursement	payment	methods	(see	Volume	4,	Chapter	1	of the	FSA	Handbook)	must,	as	part	of	their	request	for	Title	IV	funds	from	the	Department,	submit	documentation	showing that	students	were	eligible	to	receive	the	funds	disbursed	to	them	(and	for	which	the	schools	are	seeking	reimbursement). Because	final	determination	of	student	eligibility	includes	completing	verification,	HCM2	and	reimbursement	schools	may not	make	interim	disbursements.

## Updating	Information

Generally,	a	student	cannot	update	information	that	was	correct	as	of	the	date	the	application	was	signed	because	the FAFSA	form	is	a	&lt;snapshot=	of	the	family9s	financial	situation	as	of	that	date.	For	example,	if	the	student9s	family	sold some	stock	after	the	student	signed	the	FAFSA	form	and	spent	the	money	on	an	unreported	asset	such	as	a	car,	they cannot	update	their	information	to	show	a	change	in	assets.	After	the	FAFSA	form	is	signed,	only	certain	items	can	be updated	under	the	following	conditions:

- All	applicants	whose	dependency	status	changes must	update	that	and	the	related	FAFSA	information throughout	the	award	year	except	when	the	update	is	due	to	the	student9s	marital	status	changing.
- All	applicants	selected	by	the	Department	or	a	school	for	verification	of	family	size must	update	family size	to	be	correct	as	of	the	date	of	verification	unless	the	update	is	due	to	a	change	in	the	student9s	marital	status. Applicants	selected	for	verification	are	not	required	to	document	family	size	in	a	subsequent	verification	in	the	same year	if	the	information	has	not	changed.

At	your	discretion	you	may	update	either	dependency	status	or	family	size,	even	if	the	update	is	due	to	a	change	in	the student9s	marital	status,	if	you	deem	it	necessary	to	address	an	inequity	or	to	reflect	more	accurately	the	student's	ability to	pay.	Such	a	decision	must	be	on	a	case-by-case	basis,	and	you	must	document	your	reasons	for	it.	You	must	also update	all	other	pertinent	information,	such	as	spousal	income	and	taxes	paid,	to	be	consistent	with	the	new	marital status.	If	you	change	the	student's	status	to	unmarried	and	that	makes	them	dependent	(because	they	were	independent only	due	to	marriage),	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	must	be	updated	with	their	parents9	information.	If	the	student	is selected	for	verification,	update	the	application	first,	then	complete	verification	of	the	updated	application.	Your	school may	have	a	policy	of	not	considering	such	updates	after	a	specific	census	date.

However,	you	cannot	update	the	marital	status	of	an	already	independent	student	whose	dependency	status	has	not changed	because	of	their	marriage	or	divorce	and	who	was	not	selected	for	verification.	In	such	a	case	you	must	select the	student	for	verification	if	you	want	to	exercise	your	discretion	to	update	their	marital	status	and	all	other	associated information.

## Updating	information

## 34	CFR	668.55

## Parent	Post-Application	Marriage

While	the	applicant	does	not	typically	update	family	size	because	of	a	change	in	their	marital	status,	if	the	applicant	is	a dependent	student	and	their	parent	marries	or	remarries	between	application	and	verification,	the	student	must	update family	size	to	include	the	new	stepparent.	However,	the	student	would	not	count	the	new	stepparent9s	income	and	assets. A	school	can	use	professional	judgment	to	include	the	stepparent9s	income	or	to	otherwise	account	for	the	change.

## Birth	of	a	Child

The	number	of	dependents	included	in	the	family	size	is	based	on	the	number	of	individuals	who	are	claimed	as dependents	on	either	the	applicant9s	(if	independent)	or	parent9s	(if	dependent)	U.S.	federal	tax	return.	Therefore,	unborn children	are	not	included	in	the	family	size,	though	the	family	size	can	be	updated	if	the	child	is	born	and	will	receive more	than	half	of	their	support	from	the	student	(and	spouse,	if	applicable)	or	parent	(and	parent	spouse,	if	applicable) during	the	award	year.

When	the	child	is	born,	you	may	update	the	family	size	in	two	circumstances:

- 1.	 If	the	addition	of	the	newborn	changes	the	student9s	dependency	status	from	dependent	to	independent,	you	must update	both	the	dependency	status	and	family	size.
- 2.	 If	the	applicant	is	selected	for	verification,	you	should	update	the	family	size	to	be	accurate	at	the	time	you	complete verification.	The	newborn	can	be	included	in	the	family	size	if	the	child	could	be	claimed	as	a	dependent	on	the student9s	(if	independent)	or	parent9s	(if	dependent)	U.S.	federal	tax	return.

If	an	update	is	not	allowed	under	one	of	these	two	options,	you	may	choose	to	exercise	professional	judgment	on	a	caseby-case	basis	to	add	the	newborn	to	the	family	size	if	you	determine	that	the	student	(or	contributor)	has	a	special circumstance.	See	Chapter	5	of	this	volume	for	further	discussion	of	professional	judgment	and	special	circumstances.

## Correcting	Errors

As	explained	in	the	last	section,	you	only	make	updates	in	specified	situations,	but	for	students	who	are	not	selected	for verification,	you	or	they	must	correct	and	submit	for	processing	any	errors	reported	on	the	original	FAFSA	form	that	would change	the	SAI	or	the	students9	eligibility	for	Title	IV	aid.

## Changes	in	a	Selected	Applicant's	FAFSA	Form

For	students	who	are	selected	for	verification	and	receiving	subsidized	student	aid,	changes	to	any	non-dollar	item	and	to any	dollar	item	of	$25	or	more	must	be	submitted	for	processing.	Also,	if	you	are	required	to	submit	any	change	through FPS	because	of	verification,	you	must	submit	all	changes,	including	amounts	that	are	below	$25.

## Changes	to	FAFSA	Information

## 34	CFR	668.59

## Pell	Changes

If	FAFSA	data	changes,	recalculate	the	Pell	Grant	using	the	information	on	the	corrected	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary or	ISIR.	You	can	only	pay	an	increased	Pell	Grant	if	you	have	that	output	document,	and	it	supports	an	increased	Pell award.

If	the	FAFSA	data	change	results	in	reduced	Pell	Grant	eligibility	and	the	student	received	an	interim	disbursement,	adjust subsequent	disbursements	as	necessary	to	eliminate	the	overpayment.	Failing	that,	the	student	should	reimburse	the	Pell Grant	Program,	or,	if	they	do	not	return	the	overpayment,	your	school	must	reimburse	the	Pell	program	with	its	funds.	If the	student	received	Pell	Grant	money	as	a	regular	disbursement,	they	are	responsible	for	repaying	the	overpayment.	See Volume	4,	Chapter	3	of	the	FSA	Handbook	for	information	on	overpayments.

## Campus-Based	and	Direct	Loan	Changes

If	the	correction	results	in	a	change	in	the	SAI	and	the	student	received	subsidized	Title	IV	aid	other	than	Pell	Grant	funds, then	adjust	the	student's	aid	package	using	the	information	on	the	corrected	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR.	If there	was	an	interim	disbursement,	comply	with	the	relevant	rules	if	the	package	must	be	reduced.	If	there	was	a	regular disbursement	and	the	package	must	be	reduced,	comply	with	FSEOG	overpayment	rules	or	with	the	rules	for	managing excess	loan	proceeds	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.

## Selection	After	Disbursement

A	student9s	application	might	be	selected	for	verification	after	corrections	are	submitted	and	the	student	has	been	paid based	on	the	previous	unselected	FPS	transaction.	You	must	verify	their	application	before	making	further	disbursements. If	verification	does	not	justify	aid	already	disbursed,	then	the	student	is	responsible	for	repaying	all	aid	for	which	they	are not	eligible,	though	the	student	may	keep	any	Direct	Loan	money	they	received	and	FWS	wages	earned.	See	the	guidance described	under	the	&lt;Deadlines	and	Failure	to	Submit	Documentation=	section	later	in	this	chapter	for	what	happens	if	the student	fails	to	complete	verification.

## Verification	Selection	After	Disbursement	Example

AVG,	Chapter	4,	Example	3: A	student9s	application	isn9t	selected	for	verification	and	they	received	Pell	Grant and	Direct	Loans	in	the	fall.	In	December,	the	student	submits	a	correction	on	their	FAFSA	Submission	Summary that	causes	the	subsequent	transaction	to	be	selected	for	verification.	The	aid	administrator	at	the	student9s school	tells	the	student	to	submit	verification	documents	to	receive	aid	for	the	spring	and	keep	the	Pell	funds	the student	received	for	the	fall.	However,	the	student	doesn9t	submit	the	documents.	The	student	does	not	have	to repay	the	Direct	Loan	they	received	in	the	fall,	but	the	student	does	have	to	return	the	Pell	Grant,	and	the	school must	cancel	the	student9s	aid	package	for	the	spring.

## Disbursing	Unsubsidized	Aid

For	students	who	are	selected	for	Group	V1	and	are	eligible	for	both	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	aid,	a	school	may,	on	a case-by-case	basis	and	with	proper	documentation,	disburse	Direct	Unsubsidized	and	PLUS	loans	prior	to	completing verification	that	will	be	delayed.	To	avoid	exceeding	the	student9s	financial	need,	the	school	must	consider	the	subsidized aid	they	will	receive	and	adjust	the	aid	amounts	after	verification	if	necessary.

If	the	student	never	completes	V1	verification,	the	student	may	keep	the	Direct	Unsubsidized	and	PLUS	loan	aid	that	was disbursed.	However,	if	the	institution	determines	that	the	student	was	ineligible	when	they	received	aid,	see	the	relevant guidance	on	returning	aid	in	such	situations	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	3	of	the	FSA	Handbook.

## After	Documentation	Is	Complete

When	you	have	obtained	all	necessary	verification	documents	from	the	student,	you	should	compare	them	to	the	FAFSA Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	you	are	reviewing	for	payment.	If	all	the	student9s	information	is	correct	or	has	been corrected	and	there	are	no	outstanding	issues	or	unresolved	conflicting	information,	you	may	award	and	disburse	aid	for which	the	student	is	eligible.

Sometimes	schools	ask	if	even	further	verification	is	needed	to	resolve	discrepancies	between	the	ISIR	and	what	the student	provided	for	verification.	The	answer	is	no	unless	you	have	reason	to	doubt	the	accuracy	of	the	verification information.	Acceptable	documentation	either	confirms	that	an	item	was	right	on	the	ISIR,	or	it	is	used	to	correct	that item.	That	is	the	purpose	of	verification;	continued	fact-finding	is	not	necessary.

## How	to	Submit	Corrections	and	Updates

Corrections	and	updates	can	be	submitted	by	the	student	on	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	the	web	or	by	the	school using	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	or	the	Electronic	Data	Exchange	(EDE).	In	addition	to	the	following	information,	see	also Volume	3	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA	Specifications	Guide.

Note: Batch	corrections	and	updates	may	not	be	available	at	the	time	you	need	to	begin	making	such	corrections or	updates.	However,	these	instructions	are	provided	for	future	use	when	this	functionality	becomes	available.

Online	FAFSA	Form. Students	and	other	contributors	can	correct	previously	submitted	data	that	was	not	imported	from the	IRS.

FAFSA	Partner	Portal	or	EDE. An	FAA	can	submit	corrections	to	a	student9s	application	data	using	the	FAFSA	Partner Portal.	Your	school	can	submit	corrections	and	updates	electronically	by	entering	the	data	manually	in	the	FAFSA	Partner Portal	or	by	transmitting	it	to	the	FAFSA	Processing	System.	However,	you	cannot	update	an	applicant9s	or	contributor9s personally	identifiable	information	(PII)	or	consent	and	approval	using	EDE,	a	third-party	software,	or	the	FAFSA	Partner Portal.

If	your	school	isn9t	listed	on	the	transaction	you	want	to	correct,	the	student	must	provide	you	with	the	DRN	printed	on	the FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	You	can	then	add	your	school	in	the	next	available	institution	field	and	gain	electronic access	to	the	resulting	corrected	transaction.	If	all	the	fields	are	filled,	the	student	must	add	your	school	code	using	the FAFSA	online.

Corrections	and	updates	sent	by	a	school	must	be	based	on	reliable	documentation	in	its	possession	that	supports	the changes	to	applicant	data	or	signed	documentation	from	the	student	or	contributor.	Examples	of	reliable	documentation include	applications	for	admission,	acceptance	letters,	course	registration	information,	or	academic	transcripts.	Examples of	signed	documentation	from	a	student	or	contributor	on	which	corrections	and	updates	may	be	based	include	a	FAFSA Submission	Summary,	a	copy	of	the	correction	or	update,	student/contributor	statement,	verification	documents,	or copies	of	tax	returns	or	transcripts.	These	do	not	have	to	be	wet	signatures.

Note: Some	student-initiated	corrections	have	been	flagged	incorrectly	as	school-initiated	corrections	on	the resulting	ISIR	transaction.	The	Department	is	aware	of	this	defect	and	working	to	find	a	resolution.	If	your	school	is aware	of	a	transaction	that	is	flagged	incorrectly	as	a	school-initiated	correction,	you	should	notate	the	student9s file.	You	are	not	required	to	collect	documentation	unless	you	have	conflicting	information	or	reason	to	believe	the information	on	the	ISIR	transaction	is	incorrect.

Summary	or,	if	the	FPS	has	the	student9s	email	address,	an	email	with	a	link	to	view	the	student9s	updated	FAFSA Submission	Summary	on	the	web.

Paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary. Students	who	received	a	paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	may	make corrections	or	updates	on	it,	then	sign	and	return	it	to	the	FAFSA	processor	at	the	address	given	at	the	end	of	the	FAFSA Submission	Summary.	If	a	contributor9s	information	is	updated	or	corrected,	that	contributor	also	must	sign	the	FAFSA Submission	Summary	before	submitting	it	for	processing.

Students	who	applied	electronically	are	encouraged	to	return	to	their	Dashboard	on	StudentAid.gov	to	make	corrections. Students	who	applied	electronically	but	would	like	to	make	corrections	via	paper	may	have	a	paper	FAFSA	Submission Summary	mailed	to	them	by	calling	the	FSAIC	at	1-800-4-FED-AID	and	providing	their	name,	SSN,	and	date	of	birth, though	this	feature	may	not	be	available	until	later	in	the	application	cycle.

## Adding	Schools	and	Changing	a	Student9s	Address

As	with	other	changes,	a	student	can	add	schools	or	change	their	address,	email	address,	or	telephone	number	online	or on	a	paper	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	A	student	can	also	update	these	items	over	the	phone	by	calling	1-800-433-3243 and	providing	their	DRN,	though	this	feature	may	not	be	available	until	later	in	the	application	cycle.	You	can	submit those	changes	for	the	student	through	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	if	your	school	is	listed	on	the	student9s	application,	or	you have	the	student9s	DRN.

The	FAFSA	form	has	limited	space	for	a	student	to	list	schools	that	will	receive	the	application	data:	10	schools	can	be listed	on	the	paper	application;	20	schools	can	be	listed	on	the	online	FAFSA	form.	If	the	student	wants	information	sent	to more	schools,	the	student	can	use	any	of	the	methods	listed	previously	to	replace	some	or	all	the	original	schools.	If	the student	originally	listed	20	schools	on	the	application	and	then	replaced	two	schools	with	two	new	ones,	those	that	were replaced	will	not	receive	an	ISIR	from	this	correction	or	any	subsequent	correction	on	which	they	did	not	appear.

## Signatures

Any	required	signatures,	such	as	those	on	worksheets	or	on	copies	of	tax	returns,	must	be	collected	at	the	time	of verification4they	cannot	be	collected	after	the	verification	deadline	for	that	award	year.

For	verification	documentation,	a	school	may	collect	an	electronic	signature	for	an	applicant,	parent,	or	spouse	if	the process	includes	an	assurance	of	the	identity	of	the	person	signing.	This	is	often	accomplished	with	a	PIN	or	password	that is	assigned	only	after	the	identity	of	the	signer	has	been	authenticated	(see	DOC-Q12	on	the	Program	Integrity	Questions and	Answers	3	Verification).

## Deadlines	and	Failure	to	Submit	Documentation

You	must	require	students	selected	for	verification4either	by	your	school	or	the	Department4to	submit	the documentation	by	the	date	specified	by	your	school	(for	Campus-Based	and	Direct	Loans)	or	the	Department	(for	Pell).

## Failure	to	Submit	Documentation

## 34	CFR	668.60

## Campus-Based	and	Direct	Loans

If	a	student	doesn9t	provide	verification	documentation	within	your	school9s	established,	reasonable	timeframe,	you cannot:

- Disburse	more	FSEOG	funds,
- Employ	or	permit	further	FWS	employment,	or
- Originate	or	disburse	any	additional	Direct	Loans	(subsidized,	unsubsidized,	or	PLUS).

The	student	must	repay	any	FSEOG	funds	received	that	year.	If	the	student	fails	to	complete	verification	within	your school9s	established	timeframe	and	if	you	received	any	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	for	the	student	that	you	did	not disburse,	you	must	return	some	or	all	those	funds	under	the	excess	cash	tolerance	regulation	(see	Volume	4,	Chapter	1	of the	FSA	Handbook).

If	the	student	provides	the	required	documentation	after	your	school9s	deadline,	you	may,	at	your	discretion,	provide	aid	if still	within	the	Department9s	overall	verification	deadlines.

## Pell	Grants

A	student	selected	for	verification	may	submit	a	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	a	school	can	receive	a	valid	ISIR after	the	Pell	deadline	but	before	the	verification	deadline	published	in	the	Federal	Register.	If	a	student	does	not	provide the	verification	documentation	or	you	do	not	receive	the	valid	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	(if	necessary)	within this	additional	time,	they	lose	their	Pell	Grant	eligibility	for	the	award	year	and	must	return	any	Pell	money	already received	for	that	year.

## Verification	Completed	Within	Additional	Time	for	Pell

## 34	CFR	668.60(c)(1)

## Other	Considerations

The	Department	may	determine	not	to	process	the	FAFSA	form	of	an	applicant	who	has	been	requested	to	provide documentation	until	they	do	so,	or	the	Department	decides	there	is	no	longer	a	need	for	it.

A	Pell	applicant	selected	for	verification	must	complete	the	process	by	the	deadline	published	in	the	Federal	Register.	The notice	for	the	2024-25	award	year	was	published	on	September	18,	2024.	The	deadline	for	the	2024-25	award	year	is September	20,	2025,	or	120	days	after	the	last	day	of	the	student9s	enrollment,	whichever	is	earlier.	When	the	notice	for 2025-26	is	published,	the	corresponding	deadline	date	is	expected	to	be	mid-September	2026.	Applicants	to	CampusBased	programs	and	the	Direct	Loan	program	must	complete	verification	by	the	same	deadline	or	by	an	earlier	one	your aid	office	establishes.

Verification	is	complete	when	you	have	all	the	requested	documentation	and	a	valid	ISIR	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary (one	on	which	all	the	information	is	accurate	and	complete).	This	includes	any	necessary	corrections,	which	must	be	made by	the	Federal	Register	deadlines	for	submitting	paper	or	electronic	corrections.

## Late	and	Post-Withdrawal	Disbursements

Generally,	a	student	ceases	to	be	eligible	for	aid	once	they	have	finished	the	payment	period	and/or	is	no	longer	enrolled. However,	the	student	may	submit	verification	documentation	and	receive	a	late	disbursement	after	that	time	if	the Department	processed	a	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	or	ISIR	with	an	official	SAI	while	they	were	still	enrolled.	For information	on	late	disbursements,	see	Volume	4	of	the	FSA	Handbook;	for	more	information	on	post-withdrawal disbursements,	see	Volume	5.

## Verification	Status	Codes

When	you	disburse	a	Pell	Grant,	you	must	report	the	student9s	verification	status	through	the	Common	Origination	and Disbursement	(COD)	System	even	if	they	were	not	selected	for	verification.

- V 4You	have	verified	the	student.	This	includes	students	selected	by	the	FPS	and	those	your	school	chose	to	verify based	on	its	own	criteria.
- W 4The	student	was	selected	for	verification	by	the	FPS	or	your	school,	and	you	chose	to	pay	a	first	disbursement	of Pell	without	documentation	(interim	disbursement). This	code	must	be	updated	once	verification	is	complete, or	the	COD	System	will	reduce	the	Pell	Grant	to	zero.
- S 4The	FPS	selected	the	student	for	verification,	but	you	did	not	verify	the	student	because	they	satisfied	one	of	the exclusions	described	earlier	in	the	chapter	(except	the	post-enrollment	exclusion;	see	&lt;Blank=	next).
- Blank 4Report	a	blank	if	you	have	not	performed	verification	for	other	reasons,	i.e.,	because	neither	the	FPS	nor your	school	selected	the	student	or	because	the	student	was	selected	by	the	FPS	after	ceasing	to	be	enrolled	at	your school	and	all	(including	late)	disbursements	were	made.	A	blank	also	applies	when	you	disbursed	aid	on	an	initial transaction	not	selected	for	verification,	a	later	transaction	is	selected,	and	the	student	never	completes	verification.

## Chapter	5

## Special	Cases

There	are	unique	situations	where	you	will	need	to	exercise	your	discretion	as	a	financial	aid	administrator:	when modifying	data	used	to	calculate	the	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI),	adjusting	a	student9s	cost	of	attendance	(COA),	performing dependency	overrides,	resolving	conflicting	information,	reporting	cases	of	fraud,	and	determining	a	student	to	be	an unaccompanied	homeless	youth.

The	following	special	cases	are	discussed	in	further	detail	in	this	chapter:

- You	may	choose	to	exercise	professional	judgment	(PJ)	to	adjust	components	of	a	student9s	COA	or	the	data	that determine	a	student9s	SAI	to	account	for	a	student9s special	circumstances .
- You	might	also	choose	to	exercise	PJ	to	account	for	a	student9s unusual	circumstances that	warrant	making	a dependent	student	an	independent	student.
- You	may	need	to	determine	if	a	student	should	be	classified	as	an unaccompanied	homeless	youth .
- You	may	need	to	resolve	a	discrepancy	after	receiving conflicting	information for	a	student.
- In	some	cases,	you	may	suspect	that	a	student	or	employee	has fraudulently obtained	federal	funds	and	you	must report	them	to	the	Department.

## Professional	Judgment

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	(the	Act)	distinguishes	between	different	categories	of	professional	judgment	by	amending section	479A	of	the	HEA.

- Special	Circumstances refer	to	the	financial	situations	(loss	of	a	job,	etc.)	that	justify	an	aid	administrator	adjusting data	elements	in	the	COA	or	in	the	SAI	calculation.
- Unusual	Circumstances refer	to	the	conditions	that	justify	an	aid	administrator	making	an	adjustment	to	a student9s	dependency	status	based	on	a	unique	situation	(e.g.,	human	trafficking,	refugee	or	asylee	status,	parental abuse	or	abandonment,	incarceration),	more	commonly	referred	to	as	a	dependency	override.

A	student	may	have	both	a	special	circumstance	and	an	unusual	circumstance.	Financial	aid	administrators	(FAAs)	may make	adjustments	that	are	appropriate	to	each	student9s	situation	with	appropriate	documentation.	See	Dear	Colleague Letter	GEN-22-15	for	additional	guidance	and	discussion	of	the	changes	made	by	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act.

## Special	Circumstances

An	FAA	may	use	PJ	on	a	case-by-case	basis	to	adjust	the	components	of	a	student9s	cost	of	attendance	or	the	data	used	to calculate	their	SAI.	This	adjustment	is	valid	only	at	the	school	making	the	change.

The	law	gives	some	examples	of	special	circumstances	that may be	considered	(HEA	Sec.	479A):

- Change	in	employment	status,	income,	or	assets;
- Change	in	housing	status	(e.g.,	homelessness);
- Tuition	expenses	at	an	elementary	or	secondary	school;
- Additional	family	members	enrolled	in	college;
- Medical,	dental,	or	nursing	home	expenses	not	covered	by	insurance;
- Child	or	dependent	care	expenses;
- Severe	disability	of	the	student	or	other	member	of	the	student9s	household;	and
- Other	changes	or	adjustments	that	impact	the	student9s	costs	or	ability	to	pay	for	college.

This	is	not	an	exhaustive	list.	You	may	use	your	discretion	to	make	appropriate,	reasonable	adjustments	to	reflect	a student9s	situation	more	accurately.	You	may	also	use	your	discretion	to	deny	a	student9s	request	for	adjustment. However,	you	may	not	maintain	a	policy	to	deny	all	requests	for	special	circumstance	adjustments.	Your	institution	must develop	policies	and	a	process	for	reviewing	requests	for	professional	judgment.	Additionally,	your	institution	must publicly	disclose	that	students	may	request	an	adjustment	based	on	special	circumstances.	This	could	include	(but	is	not limited	to)	posting	what	may	be	considered	a	special	circumstance	on	your	website,	including	such	information	in communications	to	students,	or	adding	language	on	award	notifications.

The	reason	for	your	decision	to	approve	or	deny	a	request	for	professional	judgment	and	any	subsequent	adjustments must	be	documented .	The	documentation	must	substantiate	the	special	circumstances	that	differentiate	the	student4 not	conditions	that	exist	for	a	whole	class	of	students.	Documentation	can	include	a	documented	interview	between	the student	and	the	financial	aid	administrator	and	supplementary	information,	as	necessary,	about	the	student9s	financial status	relating	to	the	special	circumstances	for	which	the	student	is	requesting	an	adjustment.	You	must	resolve	any inconsistent	or	conflicting	information	before	making	any	adjustments.	An	FAA9s	decision	regarding	adjustments	is	final and	cannot	be	appealed	to	the	Department.

The	law doesn9t	allow	you	to	modify	either	the	formula	or	the	tables	used	in	the	SAI	calculation ;	you	can	only change	the	cost	of	attendance	components,	or	the	values	of	specific	data	elements	used	in	the	SAI	calculation.	In addition,	you	cannot	adjust	data	elements	or	the	cost	of	attendance	solely	because	you	believe	the	tables	and	formula	are not	adequate	or	appropriate.	The	data	elements	that	are	adjusted	must	relate	to	the	student9s	special	circumstances.	For example,	if	a	family	member	is	ill,	you	might	modify	the	AGI	to	allow	for	lower	earnings	in	the	coming	year	or	might	adjust assets	to	indicate	that	family	savings	will	be	spent	on	medical	expenses.

You	also	cannot	use	PJ	to	waive	general	student	eligibility	requirements	or	to	circumvent	the	intent	of	the	law	or regulations.	For	instance,	you	cannot	use	PJ	to	change	FSEOG	selection	criteria.

Occasionally	FAAs	have	made	decisions	contrary	to	the	professional	judgment	provision9s	intent.	These	&lt;unreasonable= judgments	have	included,	for	example,	the	reduction	of	income	or	AGI	based	on	recurring	costs	such	as	vacation expenses,	tithing	expenses,	and	standard	living	expenses	(e.g.	utilities,	credit	card	expenses,	children9s	allowances,	etc.). FAAs	must	make	&lt;reasonable=	decisions	that	support	the	intent	of	the	law.	Your	school	is	accountable	for	all	professional judgment	decisions	and	for	fully	documenting	each	decision.

When	considering	using	PJ,	an	FAA	should	keep	in	mind	that	an	income	protection	allowance	(IPA)	is	included	in	the	SAI calculation	to	account	for	modest	living	expenses.	Before	adjusting	for	an	unusual	expense,	consider	whether	it	is	already covered	by	the	IPA.	It	is	reasonable	to	assume	that	approximately	30%	of	the	IPA	is	for	food,	22%	for	housing,	9%	for transportation	expenses,	16%	for	clothing	and	personal	care,	11%	for	medical	care,	and	12%	for	other	family consumption.	The	income	protection	allowance	is	one	of	the	intermediate	values	in	the	FAA	Information	section	of	the output	document	(labeled	as	&lt;IPA=).	See	Chapter	3	for	the	IPA	values	and	how	they	impact	the	student9s	SAI	calculation.

If	you	use	professional	judgment	to	adjust	a	data	element,	you	must	use	the	resulting	SAI	consistently	for	all	Title	IV	aid awarded	to	that	student.	For	example,	if	for	awarding	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	you	adjust	a	data	element	that	affects	the SAI,	that	new	SAI	must	also	be	used	to	determine	the	student9s	eligibility	for	aid	from	the	Campus-Based	and	Direct	Loan programs.

If	you	make	a	PJ	adjustment,	you	must	set	the	FAA	Adjustment	flag .	You	submit	a	PJ	change	electronically,	via	the FAFSA	Partner	Portal	or	third-party	software	and	may	do	so	without	a	signature	from	the	student	or	parent.	In	the	FAFSA Partner	Portal	or	Electronic	Data	Exchange	(EDE),	you	must	select	&lt;	yes=	for	the	professional	judgment	field.	The	next	ISIR will	indicate	&lt;Professional	judgment	processed.=

Note: You	must	set	the	FAA	Adjustment	flag	(sometimes	called	the	&lt;PJ	Flag=)	even	in	some	situations	when	you have	not	exercised	professional	judgment.	Certain	FPS	requirements,	new	for	the	2024-25	processing	cycle	and continuing	in	the	2025-26	cycle,	require	you	to	set	the	PJ	Flag	to	override	FTI	received	directly	from	the	IRS.	The Department	released	the	following	guidance	on	these	unique	situations:

- Resolving	Conflicting	Information	(Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-24-71)
- Puerto	Rico	and	other	U.S.	Territories	Dual	Tax	Filers	(Electronic	Announcement	GENERAL-23-118)

If	additional	unique	situations	arise,	the	Department	will	post	additional	guidance	in	the	Knowledge	Center.

If	you	exercise	PJ	for	a	student	who	was	selected	for	verification	(by	you	or	the	Department),	you	must	complete verification	first.	This	is	to	ensure	that	you	have	correct	information	before	considering	a	PJ	adjustment.	You	may, however,	complete	verification	and	then	make	the	PJ	adjustment	on	the	same	transaction.

You	do	not	have	to	verify	information	that	you	will	entirely	remove	due	to	PJ.	For	example,	if	a	dependent	student9s parents	have	separated	after	completion	of	the	FAFSA	form	and	one	parent	is	no	longer	in	the	family	size,	you	may	decide to	use	PJ	to	remove	that	parent9s	income	from	the	FAFSA	form.	You	do	not	have	to	verify	that	parent9s	income	prior	to removing	it. Also,	using	PJ	does	not	require	you	to	verify	a	student9s	application	if	they	were	not	already selected	for	verification	by	the	Department	or	your	school.

Finally,	a	school	is	not	permitted	to	make	a	professional	judgement	for	a	student	after	that	student	has	ceased	to	be eligible,	including	when	a	student	is	no	longer	enrolled.

The	verification	page	on	the	FSA	Assessments	site	has	guidance	to	help	you	review	your	PJ	and	dependency	override procedures;	see	Activity	2.

## PJ	Examples

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	1: A	student9s	parent	had	income	earned	from	work	of	$50,000	in	2023	but	is	no longer	employed.	After	receiving	documentation	confirming	this,	the	FAA	at	the	student9s	college	decides	to adjust	the	AGI	reported	on	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	for	the	student9s	parents	to	account	for	their	reduced income.	The	FAA	also	reduces	the	income	earned	from	work	for	the	student9s	parent	to	zero.

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	2: In	2023,	a	student	had	$4,500	in	medical	expenses	that	were	out-of-pocket	costs. The	student	is	married	and	has	two	children,	so	their	IPA	is	$69,670.	Because	the	student9s	expenses	were	less than	the	amount	for	medical	expenses	already	provided	for	in	the	IPA	(11%	of	$69,670	is	$7,664),	the	aid administrator	chose	not	to	adjust	the	student9s	FAFSA	form.

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	3: A	student9s	parents	were	married	when	they	completed	the	FAFSA	form	but	have now	divorced.	The	parents	filed	their	taxes	jointly	in	2023	but	separately	in	2024.	The	student	receives	more	than 50%	of	their	financial	support	from	their	mother,	even	though	they	do	not	live	with	their	mother	due	to	college enrollment.	The	FAA	at	the	student9s	college	determines	that	the	mother9s	income	and	asset	information	should be	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.	The	FAA	decides	to	collect	the	mother9s	2024	tax	return,	since	it	only	contains	the mother9s	income	information,	and	use	it	to	update	the	2025-26	FAFSA	form.	The	FAA	also	updates	the	parent9s marital	status	to	&lt;Divorced=,	family	size	to	reflect	that	the	second	parent	is	no	longer	in	the	family,	and	tax	filing status	to	accurately	reflect	the	mother9s	2024	tax	return.

## Professional	Judgment	During	a	Disaster,	Emergency,	or	Economic Downturn

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	codified	previous	guidance	from	the	Department	(as	issued	in	earlier	Dear	Colleague	Letters) to	use	statutory	authority	to	exercise	professional	judgment	during	a	disaster,	emergency,	or	economic	downturn.

During	a	qualifying	emergency,	financial	aid	administrators	may:

- determine	that	the	income	earned	from	work	for	an	applicant	is	zero,	if	the	applicant	can	provide	paper	or	electronic documentation	of	receipt	of	unemployment	benefits	or	confirmation	that	an	application	for	unemployment	benefits was	submitted;	and
- make	additional	appropriate	adjustments	to	the	income	earned	from	work	for	a	student,	parent,	or	spouse,	as applicable,	based	on	the	totality	of	the	family's	situation,	including	consideration	of	unemployment	benefits.

Acceptable	documentation	of	unemployment	should	be	submitted	not	more	than	90	days	from	the	date	it	was	issued. However,	institutions	may	use	discretion	to	accept	documentation	older	than	90	days	under	their	general	professional judgment	authority	if	they	do	not	have	reason	to	believe	there	is	conflicting	information.

Further,	the	Department	will	adjust	the	program	review	selection	model	to	account	for	an	increase	in	the	use	of professional	judgment	by	schools	during	the	award	years	applicable	to	the	qualifying	emergency.

## The	Foreign	Earned	Income	Exclusion,	Maximum	Pell	Grant,	and	PJ

The	amount	a	taxpayer	claims	as	the	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	counts	as	untaxed	income	on	the	FAFSA	form. Because	this	appears	in	untaxed	income	rather	than	the	AGI,	it	will	not	be	counted	when	determining	students9	eligibility for	a	maximum	Pell	Grant.	As	we	noted	in	Dear	Colleague	Letter	GEN-23-11,	there	will	be	a	C	flag	on	the	ISIR	that indicates	to	schools	to	review	how	the	amount	impacts	a	student9s	eligibility	for	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	prior	to	awarding aid.	As	we	instructed	in	our	online	Q	&amp;	As	(SAI-Q5	and	SAI-Q6)	FAAs	must	review	eligibility	for	applicants	(and	their	spouse or	parent)	who	reported	receiving	a	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	and	are	eligible	for	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award.	If an	ISIR	contains	both	a	Maximum	Pell	indicator	flag	and	a	valid	value	in	the	&lt;Foreign	Earned	Income	Exclusion=	data	field, we	will	flag	the	ISIR	for	the	FAA	to	review.

The	FAA	will	determine4via	manual	or	estimated	SAI	calculation4if	adding	the	exempted	foreign	income	to	the	adjusted gross	income	(AGI)	would	make	the	student	ineligible	to	receive	the	maximum	Pell	Grant	award.	If	that	would	occur,	the FAA	must	determine	whether	it	is	appropriate	to	use	PJ	to	account	for	the	foreign	income	in	determining	the	student9s eligibility	for	the	maximum	Pell	Grant.	If	the	FAA	decides	that	it	is	appropriate,	the	FAA	may	move	the	foreign	earned income	amount	from	untaxed	income	to	AGI	or	request	additional	documentation	of	the	foreign	income	prior	to performing	the	adjustment.	If	the	FAA	decides	to	add	the	untaxed	foreign	earned	income	to	the	AGI,	the	FAA	must	check the	PJ	flag	on	the	ISIR	before	submitting	the	correction.

## Foreign	Earned	Income	Exclusion	PJ	Example

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	4: A	dependent	student9s	parent	has	an	overseas	business	that	earns	income	for which	the	parent	claims	the	foreign	earned	income	exclusion	on	Schedule	1	of	their	IRS	Form	1040.	The	FAA notices	this	amount	on	the	ISIR	and	that	the	Maximum	Pell	indicator	flag	has	been	set,	which	means	that	the	FAA is	required	to	review	the	case.	The	FAA	does	a	manual	calculation	of	the	student9s	SAI	with	the	amount	of	the exclusion	included	as	AGI	rather	than	as	untaxed	income.	Because	the	amount	is	the	maximum	that	could	be claimed	($120,000	for	tax	year	2023,	transferring	the	amount	from	untaxed	income	to	AGI	makes	the	student ineligible	for	an	automatic	maximum	Pell	Grant.	The	FAA	decides	to	use	PJ	to	move	the	amount	of	the	foreign earned	income	exclusion	to	the	parent9s	AGI.

## Refusing	or	Reducing	a	Loan

FAAs	may	also	use	their	discretion	to	refuse	or	reduce	Direct	Loan	funds	if	they	document	the	reason,	make	the determination	on	a	case-by-case	basis,	notify	the	student	in	writing,	and	ensure	the	decision	is	not	due	to	discrimination based	on	race,	national	origin,	religion,	sex,	income,	age,	or	disability.

## Refusing	or	Reducing	a	Loan

## 34	CFR	685.301(a)(8)

## Unusual	Circumstances

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	provides	a	clearer	directive	for	FAAs	to	assist	applicants	with	unusual	circumstances	to adjust	dependency	status	on	the	FAFSA	form	to	reflect	students9	situations	more	accurately	(dependency	overrides).	Like other	types	of	professional	judgments,	institutions	must	make	students	aware	of	their	ability	to	request	an	adjustment	for unusual	circumstances	by	publicly	posting	the	option	on	their	website.

An	FAA	may	conduct	dependency	overrides	on	a case-by-case basis	for	students	with	unusual	circumstances.	An	aid administrator	may	override	only	from	dependent	to	independent.	If	the	FAA	determines	that	an	override	is	appropriate, they	must	maintain	the	determination	with	any	supporting	documentation.

## Dependency	Overrides

```
HEA	Sec.	479A(c)	and	480(d)(9) GEN-22-15.
```

Under	HEA	Sec.	480(d)(9),	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	incorporated	additional	unusual	circumstances	to	consider	when	a student	is	unable	to	contact	a	parent	or	where	contact	with	parents	poses	a	risk	to	such	student.

Unusual	circumstances	do	include	(but	are	not	limited	to):

- Human	trafficking,	as	described	in	the	Trafficking	Victims	Protection	Act	of	2000	(22	U.S.C.	7101	et	seq.);
- Legally	granted	refugee	or	asylum	status;
- Parental	abandonment	or	estrangement;	or
- Student	or	parental	incarceration.

In	such	cases	an	override	might	be	warranted	based	upon	the	student9s	individual	circumstances.	These	conditions	would also	not	disqualify	a	student	from	being	a	homeless	unaccompanied	youth	or	self-supporting	and	at	risk	of	homelessness.

However,	none	of	the	conditions	listed	below,	singly	or	in	combination,	qualify	as	unusual	circumstances	meriting	a dependency	override.

Unusual	circumstances	do	not	include:

- Parents	refuse	to	contribute	to	the	student9s	education.
- Parents	will	not	provide	information	for	the	FAFSA	or	verification.
- Parents	do	not	claim	the	student	as	a	dependent	for	income	tax	purposes.
- Student	demonstrates	total	self-sufficiency.

Additionally,	the	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	introduced	new	requirements	for	processing	and	communicating	with	students who	request	an	adjustment	for	unusual	circumstances.	Schools	and	financial	aid	administrators	must:

- Notify	students	of	the	school9s	process,	requirements,	and	reasonable	timeline	to	review	adjustment	requests	after their	FAFSA	form	is	submitted;
- Provide	students	with	a	final	determination	of	their	dependency	status	and	financial	aid	offer	as	soon	as	practicable after	reviewing	all	requested	documentation;
- Retain	all	documentation,	including	documented	interviews,	related	to	the	adjustment	for	at	least	three	years	after the	student9s	last	term	of	enrollment;	and
- Presume	that	any	student	who	has	obtained	an	adjustment	for	unusual	circumstances	and	a	final	determination	of independence	to	be	independent	for	each	subsequent	award	year	at	the	same	institution	unless--
- The	student	informs	the	institution	that	their	circumstances	have	changed;	or
- The	institution	has	conflicting	information	about	the	student9s	independence.

Documentation	is	critical	3	schools	must	ensure	that	any	supporting	documentation	they	collect	is	adequate	to substantiate	the	student9s	circumstances.	Documentation	may	include	(but	is	not	limited	to)	the	following:

- a	documented	interview	between	the	student	and	the	financial	aid	administrator;
- submission	of	a	court	order	or	official	federal	or	state	documentation	that	the	student	or	student9s	parents	or	legal

guardians	are	incarcerated;

- a	documented	phone	call	or	written	statement,	which	confirms	the	unusual	circumstances	with:
- a	state,	county	or	tribal	welfare	agency;
- an	independent	living	case	worker	who	supports	current	and	former	foster	youth	with	the	transition	to adulthood;	or
- a	public	or	private	agency,	facility,	or	program	servicing	the	victims	of	abuse,	neglect,	assault,	or	violence.
- a	documented	phone	call	or	written	statement	from	an	attorney,	guardian	ad	litem,	a	court-appointed	special advocate	(or	similar),	or	a	representative	of	a	TRIO	or	GEAR	UP	program	which	confirms	the	circumstances	and	the person9s	relationship	to	the	student;
- a	documented	determination	of	independence	made	by	a	financial	aid	administrator	at	another	institution	in	the same	or	a	prior	award	year;	or
- utility	bills,	health	insurance,	or	other	documents	that	demonstrate	a	separation	from	parents	or	legal	guardians.

FAAs	may	use	a	dependency	override	made	in	a	prior	award	year	at	the	same	institution.	In	fact,	the	Department encourages	you	to	use	the	flexibility	in	the	law	to	presume	a	student	with	a	dependency	override	is	independent	in subsequent	years	unless	the	student	tells	you	their	situation	has	changed,	or	you	have	conflicting	information.	Though institutions	can	ask	students	if	their	unusual	circumstances	or	homeless	situation	has	changed	each	year,	they	should	not maintain	a	practice	that	delays	or	hinders	financial	aid	for	such	a	student,	nor	may	they	require	the	student	to	answer prior	to	packaging	or	disbursing	aid	or	require	the	student	to	submit	additional	documentation	unless	there	is	conflicting information	that	the	institution	needs	to	resolve.

To	override	the	student9s	dependent	status	on	an	initial	application	through	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal,	the	FAA	should	use the	Dependency	Override	code	of	&lt;1=	(see	Volume	4A	of	the	2025-26	FAFSA	Specifications	Guide	for	more	information).

To	authorize	a	dependency	override	on	a	paper	FAFSA	form,	the	FAA	marks	the	bubble	for	an	override,	labeled	&lt;D/O,=	in the	&lt;College	Use	Only=	area,	fills	in	the	school9s	federal	code,	and	signs.	A	separate	letter	attached	to	the	application	in lieu	of	making	the	override	is not acceptable.

<!-- image -->

If	the	student	has	already	submitted	a	FAFSA	form,	you	can	use	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	to	authorize	or	cancel	an override;	overrides	cannot	be	done	on	the	FAFSA	Submission	Summary.	If	a	student	had	an	override	done	at	another school	in	the	current	year,	that	will	be	noted	with	the	school9s	federal	code	on	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal.	Only	the	school performing	the	override	will	receive	that	transaction.	If	the	student	adds	your	school	to	the	transaction	or	gives	you	their data	release	number	(DRN),	you	can	access	the	record.

## Dependency	Override	Example

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	5: A	student	is	a	refugee	from	Ukraine	who	qualifies	for	federal	student	aid	as	an eligible	noncitizen.	The	student9s	FAFSA	form	was	rejected	because	the	student	is	a	dependent	student	and	did not	provide	data	for	their	parents.	When	the	aid	administrator	asks	the	student	for	their	parents9	information,	the student	says	their	parents	are	in	Ukraine	and	have	been	displaced	due	to	the	upheaval	there.	The	student	doesn9t know	how	to	contact	them.	The	FAA	asks	the	student	for	documentation	and	the	student	says	they	have	a	relative living	in	the	U.S.	who	can	confirm	the	situation.	The	FAA,	per	institutional	policy,	asks	for	the	relative	to	either appear	in	person	and	sign	a	statement	confirming	the	student9s	account	or	to	send	the	aid	office	a	notarized statement.	The	relative,	who	works	not	far	from	the	school,	comes	to	the	aid	office,	signs	the	statement,	and	the FAA	grants	the	student	a	dependency	override.

## Provisionally	Independent	Status

Students	can	indicate	on	the	FAFSA	form	that	they	believe	they	have	unusual	circumstances	that	prevent	them	from providing	parental	data.	Messaging	on	the	FAFSA	form	thoroughly	informs	the	student	about	what	warrants	a	dependency override	and	what	the	results	will	be	for	their	application.	If	they	complete	the	screening	steps	and	do	not	include	parental data,	they	will	receive	a	provisional	status	as	an	independent	student	and	a	provisional	SAI	calculation.	The	record	will	be rejected,	pending	further	action	from	the	student9s	FAA.	You	will	have	to	review	the	student9s	situation	and	determine	if the	student:

- Is	unaccompanied	and	homeless;
- Merits	a	dependency	override;
- Must	instead	provide	parental	data;	or
- Should	be	permitted	to	borrow	only	unsubsidized	loans	because	they	can	document	that	their	parents	have	refused to	support	them	or	to	provide	parental	information	on	the	student9s	FAFSA.

## Dependent	Students	Without	Parent	Support

Dependent	students	whose	parents	refuse	to	support	them	are	not	eligible	for	a	dependency	override,	but	they	may	be able	to	receive	a	dependent	level	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	only.	For	a	student	to	be	eligible	for	this	provision	you	must document	the	following:

- The	student9s	parents	refuse	to	complete	the	FAFSA; or
- The	student9s	parents	do	not	and	will	not	provide	any	financial	support	to	the	student	(include	the	date	support ended).

If	the	parents	refuse	to	sign	and	date	a	statement	to	this	effect,	you	must	get	documentation	from	a	third	party	(the student	is	not	sufficient),	such	as	a	teacher,	counselor,	cleric,	or	court.

This	situation	does	not	on	its	own	justify	a	dependency	override.	However,	resolving	the	situation	is	at	your	discretion.	If you	decide	that	a	student9s	situation	does	not	warrant	a	dependency	override,	you	must	document	your	decision	and ensure	that	the	student	submits	a	FAFSA	form	and	passes	all	the	eligibility	matches.	The	result	will	be	a	rejected application	with	no	SAI.	You	can	then	award	the	student	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	up	to	the	maximum	the	student would	normally	be	eligible	for	depending	on	his	or	her	grade	level	(but	not	the	amount	a	student	can	get	when	their parent	is	unable	to	get	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan).

## Unaccompanied	Homeless	Youth	Determinations

If	a	student	does	not	have	and	cannot	get	documentation	from	any	of	the	authorities	listed	under	the	&lt;Unaccompanied homeless	youth=	section	in	Chapter	2	of	this	volume,	you	(the	FAA)	must	document	and	determine	if	they	are	an unaccompanied	youth	who	is	homeless	or	is	self-supporting	and	at	risk	of	being	homeless.	Any	student	who	is	not	yet	24 may	qualify	for	a	homeless	youth	determination.	It	is	important	to	make	homeless	youth	determinations	on	a	case-bycase	basis.

A	student	is	considered	homeless	if	they	lack	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate	housing.	This	is	broader	than	just	living	&lt;on	the street.=	It	includes	but	is	not	limited	to:

- youth	sharing	housing	with	other	people	temporarily	because	they	had	nowhere	else	to	go;
- youth	living	in	emergency	or	transitional	shelters,	for	example,	trailers	provided	by	the	Federal	Emergency Management	Agency	after	disasters;
- youth	living	in	motels,	campgrounds,	cars,	parks,	abandoned	buildings,	bus	or	train	stations,	substandard	housing,	or any	public	or	private	place	not	designed	for	humans	to	live	in;
- youth	living	in	the	school	dormitory	if	they	would	otherwise	be	homeless;	and
- youth	who	are	migrants	and	who	qualify	as	experiencing	homeless	because	they	are	living	in	circumstances described	above.

The	documentation	for	an	FAA9s	evaluation	of	the	living	arrangements	of	a	student	must	demonstrate	that	they	meet	the definition	of	this	category	of	independent	student.	The	determination	may	be	based	upon	a	written	statement	from,	or	a documented	interview	with,	the	student	that	confirms	that	they	are	an	unaccompanied	homeless	youth,	or unaccompanied,	at	risk	of	homelessness,	and	self-supporting.	Such	determination	should	be	made	without	regard	to	the reasons	that	the	student	is	unaccompanied	and/or	homeless.

## Homeless	Youth	Determination	Example

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	6: A	student	came	out	to	their	parents	as	transgender	when	they	were	14.	The student9s	relationship	with	their	parents	deteriorated	and	they	told	the	student	to	move	out.	The	student	reached out	to	their	high	school	counselor	for	help,	who	asked	if	the	student	had	some	place	to	go.	The	parents	of	the student's	good	friend	said	that	the	student	could	stay	with	them.	Though	the	friend9s	family	is	providing	the student	with	a	place	to	stay,	this	is not considered	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate	nighttime	residence	as	the friend9s	family	may	revoke	their	offer	for	shelter	at	any	time.	The	student	would	be	considered	an	unaccompanied youth	who	is	self-supporting	and	at	risk	of	homelessness.

The	student's	relationship	with	their	parents	did	not	improve,	and	over	the	next	several	years	the	student	had almost	no	contact	with	them.	When	the	student	completed	their	FAFSA	for	the	first	time,	they	were	unable	to provide	parental	information	but	indicated	on	the	form	that	they	have	an	unusual	circumstance.	Their	FAFSA	was processed	with	the	student	as	provisionally	independent.	The	FAA	at	the	student9s	school	spoke	to	the	student and	requested	an	explanation	of	their	circumstance.	The	student	told	the	FAA	about	their	situation,	and	the	FAA asked	them	to	provide	documentation.	The	student	was	unable	to	obtain	documentation	of	their	homeless	youth determination	from	their	high	school	counselor.	The	FAA	conducted	and	documented	an	interview	with	the student	to	confirm	that	they	are	still	experiencing	homelessness	and	are	self-supporting.	The	FAA	helped	the student	correct	their	FAFSA	to	indicate	that	they	are	a	homeless	youth	with	a	determination	by	a	Financial	Aid Administrator.	A	dependency	override	is	unnecessary	because	the	student	is	considered	an	independent	student on	their	FAFSA	form	due	to	homelessness.

Remember	the	following	when	you	are	making	a	homeless	youth	determination:

- Ask	for	help	with	determining	eligibility	from	local	school	district	homeless	liaisons,	state	homeless	education coordinators,	the	National	Center	for	Homeless	Education	(https://nche.ed.gov/higher-education/),	or	the	National Association	for	the	Education	of	Homeless	Children	and	Youth	(https://naehcy.org/higher-education/).	Search	for &lt;Making	Student	Status	Determinations	for	Unaccompanied	Homeless	Youth=	to	find	worksheets	and	tools	to	help make	your	determination.
- Relevant	information	can	come	from	recognized	third	parties	such	as	private	or	publicly	funded	homeless	shelters and	service	providers,	financial	aid	administrators	from	another	college,	college	access	programs	such	as	TRIO	and GEAR	UP,	college	or	high	school	counselors,	other	mental	health	professionals,	social	workers,	mentors,	doctors,	and clergy.
- Use	discretion	when	gathering	information	and	respect	the	student9s	privacy.	Some	information,	such	as	that protected	by	doctor-patient	privilege,	is	confidential.	Also,	documents	such	as	police	or	Child	Protective	Services reports	are	not	necessary. Don9t	focus	on	why	the	student	is	homeless	or	unaccompanied	but	on	whether the	evidence	shows	they	are	an	unaccompanied	homeless	youth.
- Determine	eligibility	based	on	the	legal	definitions	provided	(see	&lt;Homeless	youth	definitions=	below).
- Unaccompanied	homeless	youth	may	use	the	address	of	your	school	as	their	own	on	the	FAFSA	form.

For	students	you	determine	to	be	unaccompanied	homeless	youths	or	unaccompanied,	self-supporting	youths	at	risk	of being	homeless,	update	the	answer	to	the	&lt;Student	Homelessness=	question	on	the	FAFSA	form	to	&lt;yes=	and	select &lt;Financial	aid	administrator=	as	the	determiner	in	the	FAFSA	Partner	Portal	or	EDE.	You	may	also	instruct	the	student	to make	this	correction	on	their	own	form.

Finally,	you	should	also	presume	that	a	student	for	whom	your	institution	has	made	a	determination	of	homelessness continues	to	be	independent	in	each	subsequent	year	at	your	institution	unless	the	student	tells	you	their	circumstances have	changed	or	you	have	conflicting	information.	You	should	also	consider	documentation	from	an	FAA	at	another institution	that	made	a	documented	determination	that	a	student	was	an	unaccompanied	homeless	youth	in	the	same	or prior	award	year	to	be	adequate	documentation	to	make	such	a	determination	at	your	institution.

## Homeless	Youth	Definitions

- At	risk	of	being	homeless 4when	a	student9s	housing	may	cease	to	be	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate,	for	example, a	student	who	is	being	evicted	and	has	been	unable	to	find	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate	housing.
- Homeless 4lacking	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate	housing.
- Self-supporting 4when	a	student	pays	for	his	or	her	own	living	expenses,	including	fixed,	regular,	and	adequate housing.
- Unaccompanied 4when	a	student	is	not	living	in	the	physical	custody	of	a	parent	or	guardian.

## Housing	Status	Definitions

- Fixed 4stationary,	permanent,	and	not	subject	to	change.
- Regular 4used	on	a	predictable,	routine,	or	consistent	basis.
- Adequate 4sufficient	for	meeting	both	the	physical	and	psychological	needs	typically	met	in	the	home.

## Timing	of	Determinations	of	Independence

The	FAFSA	Simplification	Act	provides	additional	guidance	on	the	timing	of	determinations	of	independence	for	certain student	populations	(HEA	479D(c)).	These	include	unaccompanied	homeless	youth	or	at-risk	homeless	youth,	foster	care youth,	orphans,	wards	of	the	court,	and	students	with	unusual	circumstances.

Institutions	must	review	all	requests	for	a	determination	of	independence	as	quickly	as	practicable,	but	no	later	than	60 days	after	the	student	enrolls.

Note	that	the	timeframe	in	the	law	is	intended	to	encourage	FAAs	to	make	determinations	as	quickly	as	practicable.	It	is not	intended	to	inhibit	FAAs	from	making	such	a	determination	when	a	student	requests	one	later	in	an	award	year.	We encourage	you	to	act	on	a	request	for	a	determination	of	independence	within	60	days	of	the	student	making	such	a request.	Further,	you	may	deny	such	requests	if	a	student	does	not	provide	requested	documentation	within	the	60-day timeframe.

## Conflicting	Information

In	addition	to	reviewing	application	and	data	match	information	from	the	FPS,	a	school	must	have	an	adequate	internal system	to	identify	conflicting	information4regardless	of	the	source	and	regardless	of	whether	the	student	is	selected	for verification4that	would	affect	a	student9s	eligibility,	such	as	information	from	the	admissions	office	as	to	whether	the student	has	a	high	school	diploma	or	information	from	other	offices	regarding	academic	progress	and	enrollment	status. The	school	must	resolve	all	such	conflicting	information,	except	when	the	student	dies	during	the	award	year	or	when they	are	no	longer	enrolled	and	will	not	re-enroll;	if	the	student	later	enrolls,	you	are	again	obligated	to	resolve	the conflicting	information.

## Requirement	to	Identify	and	Resolve	Discrepant	Information

## 34	CFR	668.16(f)

If	your	school	has	conflicting	information	concerning	a	student9s	eligibility	or	you	have	any	reason	to	believe	his	or	her application	information	is	incorrect,	you	must	resolve	the	discrepancies	before	disbursing	Title	IV	funds	and,	as	with verification,	before	making	any	PJ	adjustment.	If	you	discover	discrepancies	after	disbursing	Title	IV	funds,	you	must	still reconcile	the	conflicting	information	and	take	appropriate	action	under	the	specific	program	requirements	(depending	on the	outcome,	funds	may	have	to	be	returned).

## Requirement	to	Verify	Questionable	Data

## 34	CFR	668.54(a)(2)

## Subsequent	ISIRs

You	are	generally	required	to	review	all	subsequent	transactions	for	a	student	for	the	entire	processing	year	even	if	you verified	an	earlier	transaction.	An	exception	to	this	requirement	is	if	a	later	transaction	comes	in	after	the	student	is	no longer	enrolled	at	your	institution.	Review	the	SAI,	C	flag,	or	verification	tracking	group	for	changes.	Review	new comments	or	NSLDS	information	that	impacts	eligibility	for	aid.	Check	any	updates	or	corrections.	If	the	SAI	has	not changed	and	there	are	no	changes	in	the	C	flag,	verification	tracking	group,	or	NSLDS	information,	no	action	is	generally required.	If	the	SAI	does	change	but	it	either	doesn9t	affect	the	amount	and	type	of	aid	received	or	the	data	elements	that changed	were	already	verified,	no	action	is	required.	But	if	the	SAI	changes	and	the	pertinent	data	elements	were	not verified,	then	you	must	investigate.	Of	course,	any	time	the	C	flag	changes	or	NSLDS	data	have	been	modified,	you	must resolve	any	conflicts.

## Discrepant	Tax	Data

Financial	aid	administrators	do	not	need	to	be	tax	experts,	but	there	are	some	issues	that	even	a	layperson	with	basic	tax law	information	can	evaluate.	Because	conflicting	data	often	involve	such	information,	FAAs	must	have	a	fundamental understanding	of	relevant	tax	issues	that	can	impact	the	need	analysis.	You	are	obligated	to	know	(1)	whether	a	person was	required	to	file	a	tax	return	and	(2)	what	the	correct	filing	status	for	a	person	should	be.	The	IRS9s	online	Interactive Tax	Assistant	can	help	with	these	and	other	issues	by	walking	the	user	through	a	series	of	questions.	IRS	Publication	17	is also	a	useful	resource.

## Discrepant	Tax	Data	Example

AVG,	Chapter	5,	Example	7: An	FAA	notices	that	a	dependent	student9s	parents,	who	are	married	and	live together,	have	each	filed	as	head	of	household	(which	offers	a	greater	tax	deduction	than	filing	as	single	or married).	The	FAA	must	ask	if	that	is	the	right	status.	Resolution	of	the	conflict	could	be	the	parents	refiling	and submitting	a	copy	of	the	amended	return	or	a	reasonable	explanation	of	why	there	is	no	conflict	under	IRS	rules.

## Resolution	of	Conflicting	Information

You	must	resolve	conflicting	information	prior	to	disbursing	aid	to	a	student	enrolled	at	your	school. Even	if	the	conflict concerns	a	previous	award	year,	you	must	still	investigate	it. You	have	resolved	the	matter	when	you	have determined	which	data	are	correct;	this	might	simply	be	confirming	that	an	earlier	determination	was	the	right	one.	You must	document	your	findings	and	include	an	explanation	that	justifies	your	decision.

The	verification	page	on	the	FSA	Assessments	site	has	guidance	to	help	you	review	your	conflicting	information procedures;	see	Activity	1.

## Referral	of	Fraud	Cases

If	you	suspect	that	a	student,	employee,	or	other	individual	has	misreported	information	or	altered	documentation	to fraudulently	obtain	federal	funds,	you	must	report	your	suspicions	and	provide	any	evidence	to	the	Office	of	Inspector General	(OIG).	See	also	Volume	2	of	the	FSA	Handbook.
