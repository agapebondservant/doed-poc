The following are financial aid programs available to students who a=
re residents of the state of Minnesota.

### SELF Loans

The SELF Loan is a long-term, low-interest educational loan primaril=
y for Minnesota students who need assistance paying for education beyond hi=
gh school.The SELF program has provided over $1.7 billion in loans to stude=
nts since 1984 and is administered by the    Minnesota Office of Higher Education, a sta=
te agency.

Who is eligible?

Eligible students are Minnesota residents attending eligible postsec=
ondary institutions in-state or out-of-state, and nonresidents attending el=
igible    postsecondary institutions within Minnesota. Students must be att=
ending a SELF eligible school at least half-time and making satisfactory pr=
ogress. A SELF    eligible school is one that has a participation contract =
with the Office of Higher Education.

View a l=
ist of schools    participating in the SELF Program.

Because the SELF program is not subsidized by the federal or state g=
overnment, a credit-worthy co-signer is needed to insure continuous repayme=
nt on the    loan. By requiring co-signers and interest to be paid while th=
e borrower is in school, costs are kept to a minimum allowing for lower int=
erest rates for    students.

There is no minimum income threshold or requirement to demonstrate f=
inancial need. There are no application, origination, guarantee or other pr=
ocessing    fees deducted from the loan.
