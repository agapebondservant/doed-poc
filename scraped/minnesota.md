Saint Paul, MN 55108-5227

You must go to the website for ALL the information on each program.

The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Minnesota.

### SELF Loans

The SELF Loan is a long-term, low-interest educational loan primarily for Minnesota students who need assistance paying for education beyond high school.The SELF program has provided over $1.7 billion in loans to students since 1984 and is administered by the    Minnesota Office of Higher Education, a state agency.

Who is eligible?

Eligible students are Minnesota residents attending eligible postsecondary institutions in-state or out-of-state, and nonresidents attending eligible    postsecondary institutions within Minnesota. Students must be attending a SELF eligible school at least half-time and making satisfactory progress. A SELF    eligible school is one that has a participation contract with the Office of Higher Education.

View a list of schools    participating in the SELF Program.

Because the SELF program is not subsidized by the federal or state government, a credit-worthy co-signer is needed to insure continuous repayment on the    loan. By requiring co-signers and interest to be paid while the borrower is in school, costs are kept to a minimum allowing for lower interest rates for    students.

There is no minimum income threshold or requirement to demonstrate financial need. There are no application, origination, guarantee or other processing    fees deducted from the loan.
