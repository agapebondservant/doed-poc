South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship Information

    The South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship is a $5,000 scholarship awarded over four years to high school graduates from South Dakota who complete a    challenging high school curriculum and maintain certain academic standards.
 Eligibility Requirements
    The South Dakota Legislature established five requirements that all South Dakota high school graduates must meet in order to establish their initial    eligibility in the Opportunity Scholarship program. These requirements specify that a recipient must:

        Be a resident of South Dakota at time of high school graduation.    
        Have an ACT composite score of 24 or higher before beginning postsecondary education. If using a SAT score, the sum of the verbal and mathematics        scores on the SAT must be at least 1090.    
Complete        high school course requirements        with no final grade below a C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and a cumulative high school GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (grade of B) prior to graduation (Note: One        unit of high school credit equals 1 year of instruction).    
        Attend a university, college, or technical school accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools        and that provides instruction from a campus located in South Dakota.    
        Enter into program within 5 years of high school graduation, or within 1 year of the student's release from active duty military service (if that        release is within 5 years of the date of the student's high school graduation). Students seeking to transfer from a regionally accredited university,        college, or technical school located outside of South Dakota may do so within two years following high school graduation and be eligible to receive a        partial award.
