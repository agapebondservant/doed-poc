The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Indiana.

### Frank O'Bannon Grant Program

Frank O'Bannon Grant (formerly the Indiana Higher Education Grant) Program, designed to provide access for Hoosier students to attend eligible    postsecondary institutions, receives its funding through appropriations made by the Indiana General Assembly. The grants, targeted to tuition and regularly    assessed fees, are "need-based" and do not require repayment. Due to variations in appropriations, the number of filers and the "need" of the filer base,    the dollar value of state grants will vary from year to year.

Frank O'Bannon Grant (formerly the Indiana Higher Education Grant) includes both the Higher Education Award and the Freedom of Choice Award.

To qualify for state grant consideration the applicant must:

- be an Indiana resident;
- be a U.S. Citizen or eligible noncitizen
- be a high school graduate or hold a GED
- attend, or plan to attend, an eligible college or university    - be enrolled, or plan to enroll, in a course of study leading to an associates or first bachelors degree;
- be a full-time student, or plan to enroll as a full-time student. (The state grant defines full-time as at least 12 credit hours per term); and
- file an application (FAFSA) =E2=80=93 receive by March 10 of the year preceding the academic year the applicant plans to enroll.

NOTE: Questions about this program should be directed to the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana, Grant Division,           150 W. Market Street, Suite 500, Indianapolis, IN 46204, 317/232-2350.

    The high school guidance counselor staff is responsible for selecting the Hoosier Scholars each year. Depending upon the size of the high school, one to    three scholars are selected.
    The following general requirements apply to the Hoosier Scholar Award program, but additional selection criteria and applications may be put in place by    the high school guidance staff.
    All Hoosier Scholar Students must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) before the March deadline. Families may file    the FAFSA on-line at www.fafsa.ed.gov after the student and parent each get a Federal Student Aid pin at www.pin.ed.gov .

Twenty-First Century Scholars Gear Up Summer Scholarship 

    A major thrust of the GEAR UP program is early intervention. Indiana is making great strides in preparing Twenty-first Century Scholars to succeed in    college but their academic needs are great and many are best met by the colleges in which they enroll. Because many Scholars have not been provided with    appropriate curriculum, instruction or academic support to succeed in college, they might need to take basic preparatory courses in the summer before they    begin their program and degree requirements. In addition, they might need to take upper class summer courses to make sure they stay on track to graduate    on-time after their freshmen year. The GEAR UP Summer Scholarship pays for summer school tuition and regularly assessed and fees.
    The Summer GEAR UP Scholarship may be used by any eligible Twenty-first Century Scholar student wanting to enroll in summer courses, which may be a college    preparatory, pre-requisite or required class for their degree program. The Scholarship can be used by only by Scholars who are high school students going    to college for the first time or freshmen finishing their first year in college. It is a non-renewable scholarship that can be used for the summer sessions    before the fall of first enrollment or the summer sessions after the student's first year of college.
    In order to be considered for a GEAR UP Summer Scholarship, a student must complete an application and be=E2=80=A6

        An Affirmed Scholar admitted to an eligible Indiana college and otherwise eligible to receive the Twenty-first Century Scholarship.    
        Enrolled full time and eligible to receive the Twenty-first Century Scholarship in the fall term following the summer course session or having received        the Scholarship in the previous spring term.    
        Enrolled in either summer college preparatory classes, pre-requisites or those classes that would be considered required classes for their college        major.    
        Approved by both the appropriate office of the college where they are enrolled and where they plan to take the courses if different.    

    The GEAR UP Summer Scholarship is a grant of up to $1,500 that pays for summer school tuition and regularly assessed course fees (but it does not    cover other costs such as text books or room and board). Once the student is approved he or she will receive a letter that must be presented to the summer    school where courses are taken. The institution will also receive updated lists of approved and denied students. The institution should select one staff    member to keep track of approved students. The college is paid directly after the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana (SSACI) receives and    approves the appropriate billing documents.

Indiana  National Guard Supplemental Grant

    A grant that guarantees up to 100% of certain tuition costs will be met by the State of Indiana for eligible members of the Indiana Air and Army National    Guard. The National Guard Supplemental Grant (NGSG) covers only certain tuition charges and does not cover other expenses such as room and board and    textbooks. It is subject to available funds.
    The grant amounts are based on 30 hours of enrollment per academic year, or 15 hours per semester (or the equivalent at trimester and quarter schools). At    colleges that charge by the credit hour, students enrolled in at least 12 but less than 15 credit hours per semester will have their grants reduced if the    actual tuition falls below the approved tuition used to estimate the grant. Students at colleges that charge a flat fee for enrollment in 12-15 credit    hours will receive the maximum grant amount provided they are enrolled full-time. Note that some colleges charge a flat fee to some students but charge by    the credit hour to others if they are enrolled in evening, accelerated, adult, technology state-wide or similar programs.
    To be eligible an applicant must be certified by both the State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana (SSACI) and the Indiana National Guard (ING) and    attend a state funded college or university: all campuses of Ball State University, Indiana State University, Indiana University, Ivy Tech State College,    Purdue University, University of Southern Indiana and Vincennes University and only these schools. It can be used only in the fall and spring semesters and    not summer school.
  
 SSACI Eligibility:    Applying for the NGSG requires that the FAFSA be filed every year.

        The student must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) so that it is received by March 10th of each year they intend to enroll in        college. If necessary, the FAFSA must be corrected to make it error-free by the June 10th receipt date deadline of the filing year. Filing an        error-free FAFSA means the student will be automatically considered for state need-based tuition-specific aid including the NGSG. Receipt date        deadlines hold for both full time and part time students.    
        If the student is determined by FAFSA data to be dependent on their parents for financial support, the student's parents must be residents of Indiana        since at least December 31st of the previous year. If the student is determined to be independent of their parents, the student must be a resident of        Indiana since at least December 31st of the previous year.    
        SSACI requires that the student must be a high school graduate (including home-schooled students) or have a GED. The ING might have other restrictions.    
        The student must be seeking their first associate or bachelor degree at a state college or university. The NGSG cannot be used for graduate school or        for professional degrees such as in law.    
        Students must use state grants within a ten year period when any state grant (NGSG or other grant) is first used. Students can receive a total of eight        semesters of state aid in any combination including any state grants used prior to, after, or concurrently with the NGSG.    

  
 National Guard Eligibility:    Being certified by the Indiana National Guard means starting at the unit command level and then proceeding to the headquarters or airbase education offices    for final approval before the start of classes. Certification must be done for each term of enrollment.

        The student must be in active drilling status. The unit commander is the sole determiner of this status. This applies to each academic term.    
        The student cannot have been AWOL at any time during the 12 months prior to their enrollment in college for any academic term. The unit commander is        the sole determiner of this status. This applies to each academic term.    
        The student must complete all the required ING paperwork and must have all the paperwork approved by the appropriate ING education office before the        start of classes. This applies to each academic term. Forms and process differ by ING branch, Air and Army. Students should contact their unit        commander for details.    
        The student's name and other pertinent data as required by SSACI must be on an official list submitted to SSACI by the appropriate Air or Army        education offices of the ING, usually before classes start each term the student is enrolled.    
 

    The Indiana National Guard reserves the right, in cooperation with SSACI, to revoke for cause the NGSG at any time.
    If there are questions about Indiana National Guard eligibility and certification, the student should start with their unit commander. If the questions are    about SSACI eligibility or tuition charges or financial aid in general, the student should go to the Financial Aid Office of the school they plan to attend    or contact SSACI directly at:
         State Student Assistance Commission of Indiana        
     150 W. Market Street, Suite 500    
    Indianapolis, IN 46204

Part-Time Grant Program

    SSACI's Higher Education Award and Freedom of Choice grant programs are directed at Hoosier students enrolled on a full-time basis. An identifiable    percentage of students who are enrolled less than full time have a need for financial aid toward completion of a degree. SSACI established a program that    helps degree-seeking part-time students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing a higher education at Indiana public or independent colleges. The    program was expanded in 2000-2001 to allow students seeking certificates at Ivy Tech State College to receive awards.
    This program is designed to encourage part-time undergraduates to start and complete their Associate or Baccalaureate degrees or Certificates by    subsidizing part-time tuition costs. It is a term-based award unlike those of Frank O'Bannon Grant (formerly the Indiana Higher Education Grant) Programs    (the HEA and FOC Programs), which are offered as full-time annual awards. It is specifically designed to help those undergraduates who are taking at least    3 but less than 12 credit hours per term at an eligible institution. The students must meet State residency requirements, have filed a FAFSA and otherwise    qualify for State aid. The part-time grant is a need-based award. The minimum award is  per term. Program eligibility is determined at the institutional    level subject to approval by SSACI. First priority for the award is given to students meeting certain income guidelines.
    Although the award can be granted for all terms in an academic year, it is calculated and awarded on a term by term basis where the number of terms are    those subsidized by SSACI in an academic year, ordinarily two or three. The award is calculated in the same way as the basic Higher Education Grant using    an 80% tuition subsidy rate. Institutions are allocated a fixed amount of money to award each year.
 Child of Veteran and Public Safety Officer Supplemental Grant Program
    This program-the CVO Program-provides tuition and fee assistance at public colleges for eligible children of disabled Indiana veterans, eligible children    and spouses of certain members of the Indiana National Guard killed while serving on state active duty, and eligible children and spouses of certain    Indiana public safety officers killed in the line of duty. As a supplement to other state financial aid, the grant pays 100% of tuition and program related    mandatory fees; it does not cover other fees such as room and board.
 Students who might be covered under the veterans' portion of the program are:

        Certain graduates of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home    
        Children of Purple Heart recipient or wounded veteran    
        Children of deceased or disabled veteran    
        Children of POW/MIA from Vietnam War    

    Some program restrictions apply and financial assistance is limited to a maximum number of credit hours. The veteran must meet, or have met, certain    Indiana residency requirements, and the child must be the biological child or legally adopted dependent child of the veteran. In addition, the covered    student must be regularly admitted as an in-state student to an Indiana public college and must maintain satisfactory academic progress (as defined by the    college) while receiving the fee remission. Other restrictions might apply. An application (State Form 20234) is required. It can be obtained from the    Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs (IDVA).
    Each child must submit an application and re-application is necessary whenever a school is changed. The approved application will be returned to the    applicant. It must be presented at the financial aid office of the chosen college in order to receive the fee remission benefit. If the application is not    approved, the student will be so notified in writing. The application and supporting documentation must be mailed or delivered to the following address.    Faxed documents will not be accepted. If there are questions about eligibility for this program, the student should contact the IDVA at :
