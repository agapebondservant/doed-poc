John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program

  
    Congress enacted the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incen=
tive Act (the =E2=80=9CAct=E2=80=9D), codified at 42 U.S.C. =C2=A73797cc-21=
, to encourage qualified    attorneys to choose careers as prosecutors and =
public defenders and to continue in that service. The John R. Justice (JRJ)=
 Grant Program provides loan    repayment assistance for local, state, and =
federal public defenders and local and state prosecutors who commit to cont=
inued employment as public defenders    and prosecutors for at least three =
years.
    The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has awarded funds to all 50 s=
tates and the District of Columbia to serve eligible recipients working wit=
hin their    respective jurisdiction. Each state is required to distribute =
funding across geographic and population areas to ensure all areas of the s=
tate are equitably    represented. Funds also are to be divided evenly betw=
een prosecutors and defenders. Program guidelines are outlined below.
    Tennessee BEST Savings Program
    The BEST Prepaid 529 College Tuition Plan was established to allow p=
arents, grandparents, relatives, friends and other interested parties to sa=
ve for    future college expenses by purchasing =E2=80=9Ctuition units=E2=
=80=9D for a child based on the current weighted average tuition costs at T=
ennessee=E2=80=99s four-year public    universities. The =E2=80=9Ctuition u=
nits=E2=80=9D grow in value as the weighted average tuition increases each =
academic year.   
    Each =E2=80=9Ctuition unit=E2=80=9D purchased entitles the beneficia=
ry, that is, the person for whom the units were purchased, to an amount equ=
al to one percent (1%) of    the current year=E2=80=99s weighted average tu=
ition at Tennessee=E2=80=99s four-year public colleges and universities for=
 a =E2=80=9Cnormal=E2=80=9D academic load (two (2) semesters with    15 cre=
dit hours each). So, if a parent or other interested party were to purchase=
 100 units, they would have paid for approximately one-year=E2=80=99s avera=
ge    college tuition at a four-year college or university in Tennessee.   =
 
    Because the BEST Prepaid Plan is a qualified tuition program under S=
ection 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, the increases in the value of thes=
e =E2=80=9Ctuition    units=E2=80=9D over time are federal income tax exemp=
t so long as they are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses.&lt;=
/p&gt;
    When the child enrolls in college, the =E2=80=9Ctuition units=E2=80=
=9D can be used to pay for qualified higher education costs at colleges and=
 universities both inside and    outside of Tennessee. They can also be use=
d to cover the cost of books, mandatory fees, room and board, equipment or =
supplies required for attendance orenrollment, and computers and computer s=
oftware. The    Guide to Using Tuition Units provides examples of th=
e approximate number of    units needed to cover tuition and mandatory fees=
 and room and board at various public and private colleges and universities=
 in the state of Tennessee.  
    The Purchaser (person who opens the account) or the Beneficiary (per=
son for whom the units were purchased), must be a resident of Tennessee whe=
n the    Prepaid College Tuition Plan contract is opened. If a family moves=
 out of Tennessee after a child is enrolled in the plan, tuition units may =
still be    purchased on behalf of the child, and the child will remain eli=
gible for all plan benefits.
    BEST Prepaid Plan investments are not backed by the full faith and c=
redit of the State of Tennessee. Assets of the Prepaid College Tuition trus=
t fund are    preserved, invested and expended solely pursuant to and for t=
he purposes set forth in the laws governing BEST. For more information abou=
t the plan, please    review the Terms and Conditions information.
