John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program

  
    Congress enacted the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act (the "Act"), codified at 42 U.S.C. =C2=A73797cc-21, to encourage qualified    attorneys to choose careers as prosecutors and public defenders and to continue in that service. The John R. Justice (JRJ) Grant Program provides loan    repayment assistance for local, state, and federal public defenders and local and state prosecutors who commit to continued employment as public defenders    and prosecutors for at least three years.
    The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has awarded funds to all 50 states and the District of Columbia to serve eligible recipients working within their    respective jurisdiction. Each state is required to distribute funding across geographic and population areas to ensure all areas of the state are equitably    represented. Funds also are to be divided evenly between prosecutors and defenders. Program guidelines are outlined below.
    Tennessee BEST Savings Program
    The BEST Prepaid 529 College Tuition Plan was established to allow parents, grandparents, relatives, friends and other interested parties to save for    future college expenses by purchasing "tuition units" for a child based on the current weighted average tuition costs at Tennessee's four-year public    universities. The "tuition units" grow in value as the weighted average tuition increases each academic year.   
    Each "tuition unit" purchased entitles the beneficiary, that is, the person for whom the units were purchased, to an amount equal to one percent (1%) of    the current year's weighted average tuition at Tennessee's four-year public colleges and universities for a "normal" academic load (two (2) semesters with    15 credit hours each). So, if a parent or other interested party were to purchase 100 units, they would have paid for approximately one-year's average    college tuition at a four-year college or university in Tennessee.    
    Because the BEST Prepaid Plan is a qualified tuition program under Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, the increases in the value of these "tuition    units" over time are federal income tax exempt so long as they are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
    When the child enrolls in college, the "tuition units" can be used to pay for qualified higher education costs at colleges and universities both inside and    outside of Tennessee. They can also be used to cover the cost of books, mandatory fees, room and board, equipment or supplies required for attendance orenrollment, and computers and computer software. The    Guide to Using Tuition Units provides examples of the approximate number of    units needed to cover tuition and mandatory fees and room and board at various public and private colleges and universities in the state of Tennessee.  
    The Purchaser (person who opens the account) or the Beneficiary (person for whom the units were purchased), must be a resident of Tennessee when the    Prepaid College Tuition Plan contract is opened. If a family moves out of Tennessee after a child is enrolled in the plan, tuition units may still be    purchased on behalf of the child, and the child will remain eligible for all plan benefits.
    BEST Prepaid Plan investments are not backed by the full faith and credit of the State of Tennessee. Assets of the Prepaid College Tuition trust fund are    preserved, invested and expended solely pursuant to and for the purposes set forth in the laws governing BEST. For more information about the plan, please    review the Terms and Conditions information.
