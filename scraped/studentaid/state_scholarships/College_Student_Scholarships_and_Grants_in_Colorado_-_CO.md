## Financial Aid In Colorado

## College Costing You a Bundle?

## General Scholarships and Grants

Students planning to attend one of Colorado's many colleges and universities will want to begin their search for scholarships and grants by filling out and submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required for all federal and state sponsored student aid, and should be priority number one for all college-bound students. Once the FAFSA is submitted, and students have received their Student Aid Report (https://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), it's time to start considering financial aid possibilities.
