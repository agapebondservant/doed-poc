## Scholarships And Grants In Maine

## Find Financial Assistance for Your Education

The state of Maine provides a variety of grants, scholarships and loan forgiveness programs designed to make college more accessible for its resident students. These programs are funded by the state, and are administered by the Finance Authority of Maine (http://www.famemaine.com/index.aspx) (FAME). The state legislature of Maine has developed these financial aid programs to encourage more residents to attend college, and ultimately, to retain talented graduates within the state's workforce. Many of Maine's scholarships and loan forgiveness programs are career specific, encouraging students to pursue degrees and careers in high demand fields such as medicine and veterinary science.

As with all state supported financial aid for college students, programs are subject to change according to new legislation and the availability of funds.

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any state funded financial aid, students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine a student's eligibility for any Federal or state sponsored grants and scholarships, as well as for loans and loan forgiveness programs. The information students supply on their FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities to evaluate an applicant's eligibility for any campus-based financial aid. Collegebound students in Maine should make the FAFSA priority number one in their search for student aid.

## General Financial Aid

Maine offers three general financial aid programs for its resident students. These programs are awarded on the basis of need, and provide financial assistance to students who are enrolled at any accredited state

supported college or university. Interested students should visit the FAME

(http://www.famemaine.com/files/Pages/education/students\_and\_families/Maine\_Financial\_Aid.aspx) website for specific details on these programs, and for information on how to apply for these and other financial aid opportunities.

- The State of Main Grant Program -  This  is  a  need-based  grant  available  to  undergraduate  students  in Maine  who  are  enrolled,  or  are  preparing  to  enroll,  in  an  accredited  state  college  or  university.  Students should apply through their college of attendance. The maximum award amount is $1000 per academic year. Students may reapply for the grant every year they meet the eligibility requirements.

Students  must  attend  an  accredited  state  supported college or university. There is no limit to the number of waivers which may be issued each year.

## Career-Specific Financial Aid

Like many states across the country, Maine is experiencing critical shortages in certain high demand professions. To help address the constant need for educators, health professionals and public defenders Maine has developed a number of loans and loan forgiveness programs designed to encourage students to pursue careers in these fields. These are all award-for-service programs, and students will be expected to complete a service contract within the state in order to receive funding. Interested students will find more information on these programs at the FAME (http://www.famemaine.com/files/Pages/education/students\_and\_families/Maine\_Financial\_Aid.aspx) website.

The following career-specific financial aid programs are offered by the state of Maine for its resident students.
