## Minnesota's College Financial Aid Programs

## Don't Spend a Fortune for School

Minnesota provides a full range of financial aid opportunities for its resident students. The Minnesota legislature understands that a well educated populace is one of the pillars of a thriving economy, and so has developed a number of scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs designed to help students achieve their college ambitions. These valuable financial aid programs are administered by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/) through its interactive Get Ready For College

(http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/) website. Resident college-bound students in the North Star State will want to take advantage of the wide variety of financial aid programs available to them at the state level.

## The FAFSA

Before beginning any search for college financial aid, students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/), or FAFSA. The information students supply on their FAFSA application is used to determine the level of Federal and state financial aid for which they are eligible. After the FAFSA has been submitted, students will receive their personalized Student Aid Report

(http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which will outline the types and amounts of financial aid for which the student may apply. The FAFSA is required for all Federal and state financial aid programs. It is also used by most college, banks and independent scholarship and grant advisory boards to determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. The FAFSA should be every college-bound students first priority.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Minnesota offers its residents a variety of general education scholarships and grants designed to help make college more accessible and more affordable. These programs are not linked to any particular course of study, and may take the form of merit-based scholarships or need-based grants.

## Aid for Student with Special Circumstances

Minnesota's state government also makes provisions for students in special circumstances. These programs are designed to help students suffering specific hardship find the money they need to complete a college education.

The following programs offer financial assistance to students in special circumstances who may not otherwise be able to afford college.

- The Minnesota Veterans' Dependents Assistance Program (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm? pageID=159&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=667386d1871635b15c5401f128f25822a563dbcb) provides financial aid for  college  to  the  dependents  of  persons  who  have  been  designated  as  Missing  In  Action,  or  who  are considered  Prisoners  of  War.

Strictly speaking this is not an education grant. The intention is to make it easier for students with children to remain in college and complete their degrees.

To  be eligible, students must be enrolled in an undergraduate, graduate or certification program at a state college or university. The annual maximum awards are $10,488 for a student enrolled at a 4 year university, and $5,808 for students enrolled in a 2 year community college.

## Specialized Studies Grants and Scholarships

In addition to scholarships and grants, Minnesota's state government also sponsors a variety of programs designed to provide financial assistance to students who are pursuing careers in specific high demand professions. While not strictly grants or scholarships, these award-for-service programs offer loan forgiveness to students who agree to take up positions within the state, working at their chosen profession, in designated critical shortage facilities and communities.

The following financial aid programs are available to resident students pursuing specific careers in the state of Minnesota.

- The Federal John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm? pageID=1939&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=5b8137cac6e37c42e60a45144f17e4638653f007) is designed to address the state's need for full time public defenders and public criminal prosecutors. Law school graduates who have passed the state bar may be eligible to have a portion of their outstanding school loans paid by the state  in  exchange  for  an  agreement  to  serve  as  a  public  defender  or  prosecutor  within  the  state  for  a minimum of three years. The amount of repayment may not exceed $4000 per year of the service agreement.
- The Minnesota Department of Health (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/orhpc/funding/) offers a variety of loan forgiveness programs and grants for state residents who are pursuing careers in certain high demand medical professions. These award-for-service programs offer substantial financial assistance to students who are pursuing careers as nurses, primary care physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners. In exchange for grant  money,  and/or  loan  repayment  funds,  students  must  agree  to  serve  in  a  professional  capacity  at  a designated  critical  need  facility  in  either  an  urban  or  rural  community.  Award  amounts  are  determined  by financial  need,  course  of  study,  professional  certification  and  licensing,  and  term  of  service.  Programs  are available for the following healthcare professions:
- Rural and urban Physicians
- Nurse Practitioners
- Nurses
- Faculty Nurses and Nursing Administration
- Pharmacists
- Dentistry
