## Mississippi Scholarships And Grants

## We Tracked Down the Choices for You

College-bound students in Mississippi have access to a wide range of scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs designed to help them achieve their post-secondary educational goals. These programs are supported by the state government, and are designed and administered by the Mississippi Board of Trustees (http://www.ihl.state.ms.us/) through the state's dedicated Rise Up

(http://www.mississippi.edu/riseupms/index.php) website. These publicly funded, state supported, financial aid programs exist to make a college education more accessible to residents of the Magnolia State.

## The FAFSA

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) should be priority number one for all students looking for financial aid for college. The FAFSA is used by all state and Federal financial aid programs to determine eligibility and award values. It is also used to determine a student's eligibility for the majority of privately funded scholarships and grants. Before applying for any financial aid for college, students should make it a priority to fill out and submit the FAFSA.
