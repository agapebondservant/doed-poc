## Washington State Scholarships And Grants

## Take Care of Those College Expenses

Washington State, like other states across the country, supports a wide range of scholarships, grants and college loans for its resident students. These programs are sponsored by Washington's state government, and administered through the Washington Student Achievement Council (http://www.wsac.wa.gov/). The underlying purpose of all of these state supported financial aid programs is to make college more accessible to the resident students of Washington State.

## The FAFSA

The first step in every college-bound student's search for state, or Federal, supported financial aid is to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine the student's eligibility for government funded financial aid, and the ultimate level of that financial aid. The FAFSA is also used by many independent scholarship, grant and loan providers in the determination of financial aid awards. College-bound students should make filling out the FAFSA a priority in their search for college funding.

Like many states across the country, Washington provides a variety of general grants and scholarships for its resident college-bound students. A combination of merit-based and need-based programs, these grants and scholarships are designed to put a college education within the reach of a greater number of deserving students. As with all state-based financial aid programs, the terms and availability of Washington's grants and scholarships are subject to change according to available funding.

Many states, Washington included, support financial aid programs designed to benefit students with specific career paths.
