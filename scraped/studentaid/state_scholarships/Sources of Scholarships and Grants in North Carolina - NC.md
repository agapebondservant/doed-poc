## College Aid For North Carolina Students

## Selling Yourself for Financial Gain

North Carolina is host to an extensive selection of premier colleges and universities.  In addition to the University of North Carolina and NC State; Duke (http://www.duke.edu/), Wake Forest and Appalachian State (http://www.appstate.edu/) are located within North Carolina's borders.  Average cost of attending North Carolina State University for the 2012-13 school year; including tuition, room and board exceeds $20,000 (http://www.ncsu.edu/future-students/can-i-afford-it/), so North Carolina students of higher education face the same financial hurdles confronting other students around the country.

Large-scale federal college assistance programs serve North Carolina students, including Pell Grants, FSEOG Grants (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fseog/index.html) and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans. (http://www.direct.ed.gov/)  But when  funding shortfalls exist beyond the reach of Federal Financial Aid dollars, North Carolina students turn to state-specific assistance

(https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm) to close the affordability gap.

Since many NC financial aid programs use the federal application to qualify students, filing the Free Application for federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA) is the first step for North Carolina aid-seekers.  The application opens the door to Department of Education (http://www.ed.gov/) assistance, but it also gets the ball rolling for these forms of North Carolina financial aid:

- State sponsored
- Privately funded
- Need-based
- Merit-based
- Camous specific
- Career specific

## Need-Based Aid for North Carolina Higher Education

The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority (http://www.ncseaa.edu/) administers a far-reaching portfolio of student financial aid.  One popular program for under-funded students, the North Carolina Student Incentive Grant (NCSIG), is offered to North Carolina resident students attending  state colleges and universities full time. However, the grant does not apply to students enrolled in career courses for religious vocations.

To be considered for state aid, North Carolina applicants are required to file FAFSA requests before the state deadline. Current opportunities for state-sponsored financial aid in North Carolina include:

- Aubrey Lee Brooks Scholarship Program (http://www.ncseaa.edu/Brooks.htm)
- Golden Leaf Scholars Program - High school seniors from certain North Carolina counties are eligible to apply for  this  scholarship,  which  is  administered  by  the  Golden  Leaf  Foundation  (http://www.goldenleaf.org/). Qualified  applicants  are  eligible  for  up  to  three-thousand  dollars  annually,  or  a  total  of  $12,  000  over  the course of a four-year university program.  The state-specific effort also includes a financial assistance option aimed at Community College students within North Carolina.
- Students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (http://www.ed.gov/category/keyword/hbcus) benefit from the John B. Mclendon Scholarship (http://www.ncseaa.edu/McLendon.htm).  College funding is awarded annually to two stand-out athletes from the state who are enrolled at HBCUs.

Awards  range  between  $500  and $1000 each, and recipients can reapply for them each year.

Total scholarship  values  can  be  as  much  as  $10,000,  over  8  semesters.  The  State  Employees'  Credit  Union Foundation also funds education for North Carolina Community College students.

North Carolina Teacher Assistance Scholarship Fund (http://www.ncseaa.edu/TASF.htm) helps the state meet its growing need for qualified education professionals.  Recipients qualify by exhibiting high academic standards and financial need paying for college.  Funding varies according to legislative activity, so the number of students who benefit from the award annually is subject to change.  the program applies to initial licensure studies at qualified four-year universities, and also to community college classes that eventually lead to teacher certification at fouryear colleges.

The financial aid efforts at the school recognize academic excellence and promote diversity within the student body.
