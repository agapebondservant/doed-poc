## The FAFSA

All students applying for any Federal or state supported financial aid must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine a student's overall financial need, and the levels of government funded financial aid for which they may be eligible. All state and Federal financial aid programs, as well as most campus-based and independent programs, require the FAFSA. Students should make the submission of their FAFSA a priority before applying for any scholarships, grants or college loans.
