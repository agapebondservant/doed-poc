## Receive College Money As A Student In Hawaii

## Wipe Out Your Student Debt

Students in Hawaii may be surrounded by white sand beaches and the crystal blue waters of the pacific ocean, but when it comes time to plan for college they face the same financial hurdles as their mainland brothers and sisters. For many Hawaiian students, the rising cost of tuition makes pursuing a college education prohibitive.

Fortunately, there are a wide range of scholarship opportunities dedicated to the financial needs of college-bound Hawaiians who are struggling to meet the costs of their post-secondary education. These programs are predominantly sponsored by the state university system, as well as by other state-based charitable foundations.

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any financial aid for college, Hawaiian students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required by both state and independent scholarship and grant sponsors, and is used to determine a student's eligibility for financial assistance. Once they have submitted their FAFSA, students will receive their Student Aid Report

(http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/nextsteps/student-aid-report), or SAR, which will outline their expected family

contribution (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm) as well as the levels of financial aid for which they have qualified. College-bound students, regardless of state of residence, should make the FAFSA their first priority when searching for financial aid for college.

## Scholarships and Grants from the University of Hawai'i System

Hawaii's state university system consists of ten colleges, and more than a dozen community colleges and research centers, located throughout the island chain. These institutions are governed by the University of Hawai'i System (http://www.hawaii.edu/about/). The UHS regulates all aspects of Hawaii's state-based postsecondary institutions, including administering a variety of scholarships and grants for resident students attending any one of the state's public colleges or universities.

The following financial aid programs are administered by the University of Hawai'i System for resident students attending a state run college, university, or community college. Students may apply for any of the following scholarships and grants through their school's offices of financial aid.

Eligible students must  have  a  combined  SAT  score  of  1950,  and  must  have  a  minimum  GPA  of  3.5.
