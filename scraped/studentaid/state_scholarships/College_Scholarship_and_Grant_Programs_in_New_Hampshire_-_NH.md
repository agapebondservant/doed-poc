## College Funding In New Hampshire

## Do You Need Help with Tuition?

College students seeking aid are well-served by federal financial assistance like Pell Grants (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm) and Direct Loans (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/direct.htm), but supplemental resources are available at the state level too.  In New Hampshire, the  Division of Higher Education - Higher Education Commission (http://www.education.nh.gov/highered/) administers the state's scholarships and grant programs.

The University System of New Hampshire (http://www.usnh.edu/) maintains a solid academic tradition, with public colleges and universities totalling

12 state institutions.  Statewide, the system includes The University of New Hampshire campuses, Keene State College (http://www.keene.edu/admissions/aid/), and the campuses of Granite State College and Plymouth State University (http://www.plymouth.edu/). In addition, several campus locations make up the Community College System of New Hampshire (http://www.ccsnh.edu/).

State resources include general student assistance, as well as targeted initiatives that promote workforce development for specific professions. Landing New Hampshire financial aid starts with a timely-filed FAFSA (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/).  The Free Application for Federal Student Aid provides vital data for state financial aid administrators, who use it to evaluate each applicant's level of financial need.  Use the following New Hampshire resources to augment your federal financial aid awards.

## Specialized Studies Programs

- * Important Notice:  Due to budgetary constraints, several New Hampshire financial aid initiatives have been discontinued.  The following entries are maintained as historical references, and to provide information should these New Hampshire student assistance programs become operative in the future.

The New Hampshire Incentive Program is a need-based fund designed to make college more affordable for New Hampshire students.  Reciprocal grants allow New Hampshire students to attend colleges within the state, or at a participating school in one of the other New England states (Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island).  The New England Association of Schools and Colleges (http://www.neasc.org/) oversees the grants, worth up to $1000 per academic year, which are issued based on FAFSA findings.

The program offers loan forgiveness or loan repayment, in exchange for service at high need facilities in the state. Eligible candidates must be enrolled at participating New Hampshire institutions, and willing to fulfill work obligations following graduation.

Just as in other states, the shortage of teachers has inspired New Hamphire State Government to proactively recruit qualified students into the field (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm). New Hampshire high school juniors and seniors have the opportunity to participate in a career prep program called Exploring the Art of Teaching. Students who participate are offered incentives to pursue teaching as a career - particularly within the state. Participants also qualify for consideration for the Future Educators Academy Scholarship. Students enrolled in state teaching programs, either two-year or four-year, qualify for aid worth between $5000 and $10,000 annually.  Particpants agree to the stipulation that they teach in the New Hampshire public school system following graduation.

Students pursuing allopathic medicine or veterinary medicine are eligible for the Medical Education Program or the Veterinary Education Program. These tuition 'capitation' programs provide affordable ways for New Hampshire residents to study at fine institutions, including Dartmouth (http://www.dartmouth.edu/), Cornell and Tufts University (http://www.tufts.edu/).
