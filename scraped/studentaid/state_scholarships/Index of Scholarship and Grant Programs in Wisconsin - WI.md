## The FAFSA

Students preparing for college, who are looking for financial aid to help pay for their education, need to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required for all Federal and state supported financial aid, and is used to determine the level of financial assistance for which a student is eligible. After the student's FAFSA has been submitted, they will receive their Student Aid Report

(http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which will outline the specifics of their eligibility for government supported college financial aid programs. Students should make the FAFSA a priority before applying for any grants, scholarships or college loans.
