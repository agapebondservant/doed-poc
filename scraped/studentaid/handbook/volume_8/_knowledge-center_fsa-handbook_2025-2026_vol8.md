## Volume	8

## The	Direct	Loan	Program

## Introduction

Under	the	William	D.	Ford	Federal	Direct	Loan	Program	(Direct	Loan	Program),	the	U.S.	Department	of	Education	(the Department)	makes	loans	to	help	students	and	parents	pay	the	cost	of	attendance	(COA)	at	a	postsecondary	school.	This volume	of	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Handbook	provides	information	to	assist	schools	in	determining	student	and	parent eligibility	for	Direct	Loans,	counseling	student	borrowers,	and	awarding	Direct	Loans.

## Changes	for	2025-2026

## We	have	made	the	following	changes	in	Volume	8	for	2025-2026:

- In	Chapter	3,	we	have	revised	the	discussion	of	loan	periods	to	provide	a	limited	exception	to	the	longstanding requirement	that	the	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	may	not	include	any	terms	in	which	the	borrower	is	ineligible	to receive	Direct	Loan	funds.
- Also	in	Chapter	3,	we	have	added	a	slightly	revised	and	expanded	version	of	guidance	on	the	treatment	of	Direct Loan	disbursements	made	after	the	date	of	a	borrower9s	death	that	was	previously	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA Handbook	under	the	heading	&lt;Checking	Eligibility	at	the	Time	of	Disbursement.=	Because	this	guidance	is	specific	to Direct	Loans,	we	believe	Volume	8	is	a	more	appropriate	location.
- In	Chapter	5,	we	have	revised	Example	6	to	reflect	the	limited	exception	to	the	requirement	that	a	loan	period	may not	include	terms	in	which	the	borrower	is	ineligible	(see	Chapter	3	changes	above).
- In	Chapter	7,	we	have	revised	the	discussion	of	transfer	students	and	abbreviated	loan	periods	to	clarify	that	in	some circumstances	a	transfer	student	may	be	eligible	to	receive	more	Direct	Loan	funds	for	the	program	at	the	new school	than	a	non-transfer	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive	for	that	same	program.

Except	as	noted	above,	there	are	no	other	substantive	changes	to	Volume	8	for	2025-2026.

## Chapter	1

## Student	and	Parent	Eligibility	for	Direct	Loans

## Overview

To	be	eligible	for	Direct	Loans,	a	student	must	be	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis	at	a	school	that	participates	in	the Direct	Loan	Program,	and	students	and	parents	must	meet	the	general	federal	student	aid	eligibility	requirements covered	in	Volume	1	of	the	Federal	Student	Aid	Handbook.	This	chapter	discusses	other	eligibility	requirements	that	are specific	to	the	Direct	Loan	Program.

## Direct	Loan	Program	Regulations

## 34	CFR	Part	685

## Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans

Only	students	who	have	financial	need	may	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.	The	federal	government	does	not	charge interest	on	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	while	the	borrower	is	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis,	during	the	grace	and deferment	periods,	and	during	certain	other	periods	(for	example,	during	certain	periods	of	repayment	under	certain repayment	plans	that	determine	the	required	monthly	payment	amount	based	on	the	borrower9s	income	and	family	size).

If	a	student	has	received	a	determination	of	need	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	in	an	amount	of	$200	or	less,	a	school	may choose	not	to	originate	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	may	instead	include	that	amount	as	part	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan.

Financial	need	is	not	an	eligibility	requirement	to	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan.	The	federal	government	generally charges	interest	on	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	during	all	periods,	with	limited	exceptions	(for	example,	during	periods	of deferment	for	cancer	treatment).

To	be	eligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	an	undergraduate	student	attending	a school	that	participates	in	the	Federal	Pell	Grant	Program	must	first	have	received	a	determination	of	their	Pell	Grant eligibility	for	the	period	of	enrollment	for	which	the	student	is	requesting	a	loan.

No	Minimum	Age	To	Receive	a	Direct	Loan

Students	who	are	minors	may	receive	Direct	Loans,	but	they	may	not	refuse	to	repay	the	loans	based	on	a	&lt;defense	of infancy=	(that	is,	by	claiming	that	they	were	too	young	to	enter	into	the	contract	of	signing	the	promissory	note).

No	Defense	of	Infancy

Higher	Education	Act	(HEA)	Sec.	484A(b)(2)

Requirement	To	Offer	Both	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Loans

Direct	Subsidized	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	are	two	components	of	a	single	loan	program.	A	school	may	not	choose to	make	only	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	or	only	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	available	to	its	eligible	students.	For	more information,	see	the	discussion	under	&lt;Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans=	in	DCL	GEN-11-07.

Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	for	Students	Whose	Parents	Have	Ended	Financial	Support	or	Refuse	To	File	a	FAFSA	Form

If	you	verify	that	the	parents	of	a	dependent	undergraduate	student	have	refused	to	complete	the	parental	information sections	of	the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA)	form	or	that	they	have	ended	financial	support	for	the student,	you	may	make	a	professional	judgment	decision	to	offer	the	student	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	in	an	amount	up to	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	for	a	dependent	undergraduate.	For	instance,	under	these	circumstances	a	dependent second-year	undergraduate	could	receive	up	to	$6,500	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	(see	Chapter	4	of	this	volume for	information	on	annual	loan	limits).	However,	the	student	may	not	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	or	aid	from	any	of the	other	Title	IV	programs.

Self-certification	from	the	dependent	student	is	not	sufficient	to	verify	that	the	parents	have	ended	financial	support	or have	refused	to	complete	the	FAFSA	form.	In	most	cases,	this	requirement	can	be	met	by	obtaining	a	signed	and	dated statement	from	one	of	the	student9s	parents.	For	more	information,	see	the	discussion	under	&lt;Dependent	students without	parent	support=	in	the	&lt;Professional	Judgment=	section	of	Chapter	5	of	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide.

## Direct	PLUS	Loans

Direct	PLUS	Loans	are	available	to	graduate	and	professional	students,	and	to	the	parents	of	dependent	undergraduate students.

A	parent	may	receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	only	to	pay	for	the	education	costs	of	a	dependent	undergraduate	student	who meets	the	eligible	student	definition.	A	parent	borrower	must	meet	the	same	citizenship	and	residency	requirements	as	a student.	Similarly,	a	parent	who	is	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan,	or	who	owes	an	overpayment	on	a	Title	IV	grant,	is ineligible	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	unless	they	have	made	satisfactory	arrangements	to	repay	the	loan	or	grant.	A	parent who	had	a	prior	Title	IV	loan	discharged	for	total	and	permanent	disability	must	meet	the	same	eligibility	requirements outlined	for	student	borrowers	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	3.	Finally,	a	parent	is	not	eligible	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	if	the	federal government	holds	a	judgment	lien	on	their	property	or	if	the	parent	is	incarcerated.	Note,	however,	that	a	parent9s ineligibility	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	does	not	affect	the	student9s	eligibility	for	other	Title	IV	aid,	assuming	that	the	student is	otherwise	eligible.

## Requirement	To	Offer	Direct	PLUS	Loans	to	Both	Student	and	Parent	Borrowers

Schools	may	choose	whether	to	offer	Direct	PLUS	Loans.	If	your	school	chooses	to	participate	in	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan Program	and	has	both	undergraduate	and	graduate	or	professional	students,	you	must	make	Direct	PLUS	Loans	available to	both	the	parents	of	dependent	undergraduate	students	and	to	graduate	or	professional	students.	You	may	not	limit Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrowing	only	to	parents	or	only	to	graduate	or	professional	students.	For	more	information,	see	the discussion	under	&lt;Direct	PLUS	Loans=	in	DCL	GEN-11-07.

## Definition	of	&lt;Parent=	for	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Purposes

If	they	meet	all	other	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility	requirements,	the	following	individuals	can	borrow	Direct	PLUS	Loans	on behalf	of	a	dependent	undergraduate	student:

- The	student9s	biological	parent;
- The	student9s	legal	adoptive	parent;	or
- The	student9s	stepparent	(spouse	of	the	student9s	biological	or	legal	adoptive	parent	at	the	time	of	application),	but only	if	the	stepparent	is	required	to	provide	their	information	on	the	FAFSA	form	in	accordance	with	the	instructions on	the	FAFSA	form.

Grandparents	and	other	family	members	are	not	eligible	to	take	out	Direct	PLUS	Loans	on	behalf	of	a	dependent undergraduate	student	unless	they	have	legally	adopted	the	student.

In	addition	to	the	parent(s)	whose	resources	are	reported	on	a	student9s	FAFSA	form,	any	otherwise	eligible	biological	or legal	adoptive	parent	of	the	dependent	undergraduate	student	can	also	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	on	the	student9s behalf,	even	if	that	parent9s	information	is	not	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.

Note	also	that	more	than	one	parent	can	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	on	behalf	of	the	same	dependent	undergraduate student.	For	example,	if	a	student9s	biological	or	legal	adoptive	parents	are	divorced,	they	may	decide	to	each	take	out	a Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	an	agreed	upon	amount	(not	to	exceed	the	student9s	COA,	minus	other	financial	assistance	(OFA))	to help	pay	for	the	cost	of	the	student9s	education.

## Requirement	for	Dependent	Students	To	File	a	FAFSA	Form

In	all	cases,	the	dependent	student	on	whose	behalf	a	parent	has	applied	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	must	have	filed	a	FAFSA form	and	received	an	Institutional	Student	Information	Record	(ISIR)	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	(see	Chapter	1	of	the Application	and	Verification	Guide	for	information	on	the	ISIR	and	FAFSA	Submission	Summary).	This	requirement	ensures that	student	eligibility	data	matches	are	conducted	to	verify	that	the	dependent	student	on	whose	behalf	the	parent	is borrowing:

- Is	not	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan	and	does	not	owe	an	overpayment	on	a	Title	IV	grant;
- Has	had	their	Social	Security	number	verified	by	the	Social	Security	Administration;	and
- Has	had	their	citizenship	status	confirmed	by	either	the	Social	Security	Administration	or	the	Department	of Homeland	Security.

Note	that	this	requirement	is	for	the student to	submit	a	FAFSA	form.	It	is	not	a	requirement	for	the	parent	borrower	to submit	a	FAFSA	form	in	the	parent9s	name,	and	it	does	not	preclude	an	otherwise	eligible	parent	whose	information	is	not included	on	the	FAFSA	form	(sometimes	referred	to	as	a	&lt;non-custodial=	parent)	from	obtaining	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

Before	originating	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	a	parent	borrower,	schools	must	review	the	ISIR	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary of	the	dependent	student	to	ensure	there	are	no	student	eligibility	issues	that	must	be	resolved	before	the	parent	can receive	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

## Adverse	Credit	History

An	individual	with	an	adverse	credit	history	is	prohibited	from	obtaining	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	unless	they	meet	additional eligibility	requirements.	The	Department	obtains	a	credit	report	on	each	student	or	parent	applicant	for	a	Direct	PLUS Loan.	An	applicant	is	considered	to	have	an	adverse	credit	history	if:

- They	have	one	or	more	debts	with	a	total	combined	outstanding	balance	greater	than	$2,085	that	(1)	are	90	or	more days	delinquent	as	of	the	date	of	the	credit	report,	or	(2)	have	been	placed	in	collection	or	charged-off	during	the	two years	preceding	the	date	of	the	credit	report;	or
- During	the	five	years	preceding	the	date	of	the	credit	report,	the	applicant	has	been	determined	to	be	in	default	on	a debt;	has	had	debts	discharged	in	bankruptcy;	or	has	been	the	subject	of	foreclosure,	repossession,	tax	lien,	wage garnishment,	or	write-off	of	a	Title	IV	debt.

For	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility	purposes,	&lt;charged-off=	means	a	debt	that	has	been	written	off	as	a	loss,	but	that	is	still subject	to	collection	action.	&lt;In	collection=	means	a	debt	that	has	been	placed	with	a	collection	agency	by	a	creditor	or that	is	subject	to	more	intensive	efforts	by	a	creditor	to	recover	amounts	owed	from	a	borrower	who	has	not	responded satisfactorily	to	the	routine	demands	of	the	creditor9s	billing	procedures.

An	applicant	cannot	be	denied	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	because	they	have	no	credit	history.	That	is,	the	absence	of	a	credit history	is	not	considered	to	be	adverse	credit.

There	are	two	means	by	which	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	with	an	adverse	credit	history	can	still	qualify	for	a	Direct PLUS	Loan.	One	option	is	for	the	applicant	to	obtain	an	endorser	who	doesn9t	have	an	adverse	credit	history.	An	endorser is	someone	who	agrees	to	repay	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	if	the	borrower	doesn9t	repay	it.	For	a	parent	borrower,	the endorser	may	not	be	the	dependent	student	for	whom	the	parent	is	borrowing.

As	an	alternative	to	obtaining	an	endorser,	an	applicant	who	has	been	determined	to	have	an	adverse	credit	history	may also	qualify	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	by	submitting	documentation	to	the	Department	showing	that	there	are	extenuating circumstances	associated	with	the	adverse	credit.	The	Department	has	the	final	decision	on	determining	whether extenuating	circumstances	exist.

A	borrower	who	qualifies	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	by	obtaining	an	endorser	or	documenting	to	the	satisfaction	of	the Department	that	extenuating	circumstances	exist	must	also	complete	PLUS	Loan	Credit	Counseling,	as	discussed	below.

If	your	school	participates	in	the	Direct	PLUS	program	but	a	student9s	parent	cannot	obtain	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	the student	is	allowed	to	borrow	additional	unsubsidized	funds	(see	&lt;Criteria	for	Dependent	Students	to	Receive	Additional Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Funds=	in	Chapter	4	of	this	volume).

Definition	of	&lt;Adverse	Credit	History=

## 34	CFR	685.200(c)(2)(viii)(B)

34	CFR	685.200(b)(5)

## Required	Counseling	for	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Applicants	With	Adverse	Credit

Any	student	or	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	who	has	an	adverse	credit	history	but	qualifies	by	obtaining	an	endorser or	documenting	that	there	are	extenuating	circumstances	must	also	complete	PLUS	Loan	Credit	Counseling	on	the Department9s	StudentAid.gov	website.

## Adverse	Credit	History	and	Default

Although	a	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan	will	generally	appear	in	a	student	or	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant9s	credit	record and	result	in	the	individual	being	determined	to	have	an	adverse	credit	history,	being	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan	and having	an	adverse	credit	history	are	separate	eligibility	issues.	A	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	who	is	identified	through	the Department9s	National	Student	Loan	Data	System	(NSLDS)	as	being	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan	and	who	has	also	been determined	to	have	an	adverse	credit	history	(due	to	the	default	and/or	other	adverse	credit	conditions)	cannot	qualify	for a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	simply	by	obtaining	an	endorser	or	by	providing	acceptable	documentation	of	extenuating circumstances.	The	applicant	must	also	separately	resolve	the	default	status	by	one	of	the	means	discussed	under &lt;Resolving	Default	Status=	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	3.

In	some	cases,	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	credit	check	may	not	reveal	a	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan,	particularly	if	the	default	is not	recent.	If	a	student	or	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	who	is	identified	in	NSLDS	as	being	in	default	on	a	Title	IV loan	does	not	have	any	other	adverse	credit	issues,	the	applicant	will	pass	the	PLUS	credit	check.	In	this	circumstance	you cannot	assume	that	the	approved	credit	check	result	supersedes	the	information	in	NSLDS.	The	default	must	be	resolved before	you	can	disburse	Direct	PLUS	Loan	funds	or	other	Title	IV	aid	to	the	applicant.

## Direct	PLUS	Loan	Application

Schools	that	offer	Direct	PLUS	Loans	have	the	option	of	requiring	student	and	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants	to complete	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Application	(formally	known	as	the	"Federal	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Request	for	Supplemental Information")	on	the	Department's	StudentAid.gov	website	as	the	first	step	in	applying	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	The	Direct PLUS	Loan	Application	collects	the	requested	loan	amount,	the	period	of	enrollment	for	which	the	loan	is	intended,	and other	information	related	to	processing	the	requested	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

Use	of	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Application	on	StudentAid.gov	is	not	required.	Schools	may	choose	to	develop	their	own processes	for	obtaining	the	information	needed	to	originate	Direct	PLUS	Loans.

Although	the	Department9s	FAFSA	Processing	System	(FPS)	matches	student	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants	against	NSLDS to	determine	if	they	are	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan,	it	does	not	perform	this	match	for	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants. However,	the	Department	conducts	an	NSLDS	default	check	on	all	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants	(both	students	and parents)	who	complete	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Application	on	StudentAid.gov.

Schools	that	use	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Application	are	notified	of	the	result	of	the	NSLDS	default	check	through	the Common	Origination	and	Disbursement	(COD)	System.	The	result	is	reported	as	one	of	the	following	values:

- "N"	=	The	borrower	is	not	in	default	on	any	Title	IV	loan.
- "Y"	=	The	borrower	is	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan.
- "E"	=	Unable	to	determine	if	the	borrower	is	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan.

If	the	result	is	"N,"	a	student	or	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	who	meets	all	other	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility requirements	may	receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

If	the	result	is	"Y,"	the	student	or	parent	may	not	receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	(or	any	other	Title	IV	aid)	until	the	default status	is	resolved	(see	"Resolving	Default	Status"	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	3	for	more	information).

A	result	of	"E"	may	be	reported	if	for	some	reason	it	was	not	possible	to	conclusively	determine	that	the	applicant	is	not	in default.	An	&lt;E=	result	is	most	commonly	due	to	temporary	systems	issues	involving	the	interface	between	the	Direct	PLUS Loan	Application	and	NSLDS.	In	this	case,	if	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	is	a	graduate	or	professional	student	and	the NSLDS	match	performed	by	the	FPS	indicates	that	the	student	is	not	in	default,	you	may	rely	on	the	results	of	that	check. If	the	applicant	is	a	parent,	you	must	separately	check	NSLDS	to	confirm	that	the	parent	is	not	in	default	before originating	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

IMPORTANT: If	you	do	not	require	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants	at	your	school	to	complete	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan Application,	you	must	check	NSLDS	for	all parent Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicants	to	confirm	that	they	are	not	in default	before	originating	Direct	PLUS	Loans	for	these	individuals.

## Ineligible	Borrowers

The	Department	may	determine	that	a	borrower	was	ineligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	if,	at	the	time	the	loan	was	made and	without	the	knowledge	of	the	Department	or	the	school,	the	borrower	(or	the	dependent	student	on	whose	behalf	a parent	received	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan)	provided	false	information,	was	convicted	of	or	pled	no	contest	or	guilty	to	a	crime involving	fraud	in	obtaining	Title	IV	funds,	or	took	actions	that	caused	the	borrower	or	student	to	receive:

- Loan	funds	for	which	they	were	wholly	or	partially	ineligible;
- Interest	benefits	on	a	loan	for	which	they	were	ineligible;	or
- Loan	funds	for	a	period	of	enrollment	for	which	they	were	ineligible.

If	the	Department	determines	that	a	Direct	Loan	borrower	was	ineligible,	the	Department	sends	the	borrower	a	demand letter	that	requires	the	borrower	to	repay	some	or	all	of	the	loan	the	borrower	received,	as	applicable,	within	30	days.	If the	borrower	fails	to	comply	with	the	letter,	the	borrower	is	considered	in	default	on	the	entire	loan.

## Direct	Loans	at	Multiple	Schools

A	student	who	is	concurrently	enrolled	and	eligible	at	more	than	one	school	may	receive	Direct	Loans	at	each	school.	If the	student	is	receiving	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	the	schools	that	the	student	is	attending are	responsible	for	coordinating	to	make	sure	that	the	total	amount	of	the	loans	the	student	receives	does	not	exceed	the applicable	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limit.	In	addition,	the	schools	must	ensure	that	there	is	no	duplication	of	noninstitutional	costs	when	determining	the	student9s	COA.	Note	that	in	the	situation	where	a	student	is	concurrently	enrolled and	eligible	at	more	than	one	school,	which	is	different	than	the	consortium	arrangements	discussed	in	Volume	2,	Chapter 2,	loan	funds	awarded	at	one	school	are	not	to	be	included	as	OFA	by	any	other	school	the	student	is	attending	when determining	the	student9s	loan	eligibility	for	the	same	period.

## Exceptions	to	the	&lt;Regular	Student=	Requirement	for	Direct	Loans

As	explained	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	1,	one	of	the	eligibility	requirements	for	a	student	to	receive	Title	IV	aid	is	that	the student	must	be	enrolled	at	an	eligible	school	for	the	purpose	of	obtaining	a	degree	or	certificate	offered	by	the	school. Such	a	student	is	known	as	a	&lt;regular	student.=	However,	there	are	two	limited	exceptions	to	this	requirement	for	Direct Loans:	preparatory	coursework	and	teacher	certification	coursework.

## Regular	Student

## 34	CFR	600.2

## Preparatory	Coursework

A	student	may	receive	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	(or	a	parent	may	receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan on	behalf	of	a	dependent	student)	for	preparatory	coursework	that	the	school	has	documented	is	necessary	for	the student	to	enroll	in	an	eligible	program.	The	preparatory	courses	must	be	offered	as	part	of	an	eligible	program	offered	by the	school,	though	the	student	does	not	have	to	be	enrolled	in	that	program.	A	school	may	not	award	Direct	Loans	for standalone	courses	that	do	not	count	towards	an	eligible	program	and	exist	solely	to	serve	as	preparatory	coursework.

A	student	who	is	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	preparatory	coursework	as	described	above	is	eligible	to	receive	loans	for	a maximum	of	one	consecutive	12-month	period	(not	per	program)	beginning	on	the	first	day	of	the	loan	period.	If	the consecutive	12-month	period	of	preparatory	coursework	spans	more	than	one	academic	year,	the	student	may	receive more	than	one	annual	loan	limit.

To	be	eligible	for	loans	under	this	exception,	the	student	must	be	taking	classes	that	are	a	prerequisite	for	admission.	A student	who	is	only	taking	courses	to	raise	their	grade-point	average	in	order	to	be	admitted	does	not	qualify.

## Preparatory	Coursework

A	student	may	take	the	preparatory	courses	at	School	A	(as	long	as	the	courses	are	part	of	an	eligible	program	there)	that are	required	for	admission	into	a	program	at	School	B.	As	the	awarding	school,	School	A	may	require	documentation	from School	B	that	these	courses	are	required	for	the	student9s	subsequent	enrollment.

Volume	8,	Chapter	1,	Example	1:	Eligible	Preparatory	Coursework

A	student	who	previously	received	a	bachelor9s	degree	with	a	major	in	mathematics	now	wants	to	enroll	in	a graduate	computer	science	program.	The	student	needs	12	more	semester	hours	of	computer	science	coursework to	meet	the	admission	requirements	of	the	school	that	offers	the	program.	The	student	enrolls	in	courses	that	are part	of	one	of	the	school9s	undergraduate	degree	programs,	but	is	not	enrolled	for	the	purpose	of	receiving	a degree	and	therefore	is	not	a	regular	student.	However,	because	the	coursework	is	necessary	for	enrollment	in the	graduate	program,	the	student	may	receive	Direct	Loans	for	this	coursework	(for	a	maximum	of	one consecutive	12-month	period).

Volume	8,	Chapter	1,	Example	2:	Ineligible	Preparatory	Coursework

A	nursing	school	offers	a	2-year	program	leading	to	a	diploma.	This	is	the	only	Title	IV	eligible	program	offered	by the	school.	To	be	admitted	to	the	program,	students	must	have:

- Received	a	high	school	diploma	or	general	educational	development	(GED)	certificate;
- Completed	Human	Anatomy	and	Physiology	with	a	minimum	grade	of	&lt;C=;
- Completed	college	level	English	Composition	with	a	minimum	grade	of	&lt;C=;	and
- Completed	college	level	Algebra	with	a	minimum	grade	of	&lt;C=.

For	applicants	who	have	not	successfully	completed	post-secondary	courses	in	Human	Anatomy	and	Physiology, English	Composition,	and	Algebra,	the	school	offers	8-week	courses	that	upon	successful	completion	qualify applicants	for	admission.	Because	the	school	does	not	offer	a	Title	IV	eligible	program	that	includes	its	courses	in Human	Anatomy	and	Physiology,	English	Composition,	and	Algebra,	students	enrolled	in	those	stand-alone courses	are	not	eligible	to	receive	Title	IV	funds.

## Direct	Loan	Eligibility	After	an	Enrollment	Status	Change

If	a	student	who	received	a	disbursement	of	Direct	Loan	funds	prior	to	the	first	day	of	classes	of	a	payment	period	begins attendance	on	a	less-than-half-time	basis,	there	is	no	requirement	for	the	school	or	the	student	to	return	the	loan	funds	as long	as:

- The	student	began	attendance	in	at	least	one	course	during	the	payment	period;	and
- At	the	time	of	the	loan	disbursement	the	student	was	enrolled	(registered)	for	classes	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis.

However,	the	school	must	not	make	any	subsequent	disbursements	of	the	loan	unless	the	student	resumes	enrollment	on at	least	a	half-time	basis	during	the	payment	period.

A	student	who	is	no	longer	enrolled	at	least	half	time	may	not	receive	as	a	late	disbursement	any	second	or	subsequent disbursement	of	the	loan.

Note	that	different	requirements	apply	if	a	student	who	received	a	Direct	Loan	disbursement	prior	to	the	first	day	of classes	fails	to	begin	attendance	in	any	classes.	See	&lt;When	A	Student	Fails	to	Begin	Attendance=	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	3.

If	a	student	does	not	withdraw	but	ceases	to	be	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis,	a	school	may	make	a	late disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan	for	costs	incurred	by	the	student	for	a	period	in	which	the	student	was	eligible.	However, this	does	not	apply	if	the	student	dropped	all	future	classes	or	modules,	because	the	student	never	began	classes	as	a half-time	student.

Title	IV	program	funds	(including	Direct	Loans)	are	disbursed	to	a	student	on	the	presumption	that	the	student	will	attend the	hours	for	which	aid	has	been	awarded.	Therefore,	a	school	is	not	required	to	delay	the	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan until	a	student	has	begun	attendance	in	enough	hours	to	establish	half-time	enrollment	status.	However,	if	a	school	has not	yet	made	a	Direct	Loan	disbursement	to	a	student	who	has	dropped	classes,	and	the	school	determines	that	the student	never	began	attendance	in	enough	classes	to	establish	half-time	enrollment	status,	the	school	may	not	make	a first	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan	to	that	student.

Likewise,	if	a	student	who	was	enrolled	in	a	series	of	modules	drops	all	future	classes	before	beginning	attendance	in enough	modules	to	establish	half-time	enrollment	status,	the	school	may	not	make	a	first	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan because	the	student	never	began	attendance	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis.	If	a	student	who	dropped	to	less-than-half-time status	resumes	enrollment	on	a	half-time	basis	during	the	payment	period	or	period	of	enrollment,	the	school	may	make remaining	disbursements	of	a	Direct	Loan	if	the	school	documents	(1)	the	student9s	revised	COA,	and	(2)	that	the	student continues	to	qualify	for	the	entire	amount	of	the	loan,	despite	any	reduction	in	the	student9s	COA	caused	by	the temporary	cessation	of	enrollment	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis.

## Direct	Loan	Eligibility	After	Inadvertent	Overborrowing

A	student	who	has	inadvertently	received	Direct	Loan	funds	in	excess	of	the	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits	is	ineligible	to receive	any	Title	IV	funds	until	the	overborrowing	is	resolved.	As	explained	in	more	detail	below,	the	student	can	regain eligibility	for	aid	by	repaying	the	amount	that	exceeded	the	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits,	or	by	making	satisfactory arrangements	with	the	loan	servicer	to	repay	the	excess	amount.

The	school	where	the	student	is	requesting	additional	Title	IV	funds	is	responsible	for	identifying	the	loan(s)	that	resulted in	the	overborrowing,	determining	that	the	overborrowing	was	inadvertent,	discussing	the	overborrowing	with	the student,	and	resolving	any	discrepancies	in	the	information	that	is	obtained.	If	the	loan(s)	that	caused	the	student	to exceed	the	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limit	were	received	for	attendance	at	a	different	school,	in	some	cases	it	may	be necessary	for	the	school	the	student	is	currently	attending	to	contact	the	other	school	for	additional	information	in	order to	determine	that	the	excess	borrowing	was	inadvertent.

Examples	of	circumstances	that	may	have	resulted	in	a	student	inadvertently	exceeding	an	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limit include,	but	are	not	limited	to:

- School	processing	errors;
- Missing	or	incorrect	NSLDS	information;	or
- Unintentional	student	error	or	omission.

Overborrowing	is	not	considered	inadvertent	if	there	is	any	evidence	that	it	was	the	result	of	deliberate	action	on	the	part of	the	school	that	determined	the	borrower9s	eligibility	for	the	loan,	or	on	the	part	of	the	borrower	who	received	the	loan. If	a	school	determines	that	the	overborrowing	was	the	result	of	deliberate	action	on	the	part	of	another	school	or	the borrower,	it	must	notify	the	Department9s	Office	of	the	Inspector	General	and	provide	evidence	(see	the	contact	number at	the	end	of	this	section).

Once	the	school	where	the	student	is	requesting	Title	IV	funds	has	documented	that	the	student	has	either	repaid	the excess	loan	amount	or	has	made	satisfactory	arrangements	to	repay	the	excess	amount,	it	may	award	additional	aid.	For Direct	Loans,	the	student9s	eligibility	is	retroactive	to	the	beginning	of	the	academic	year	in	which	the	overborrowing	was resolved.

A	student	who	regains	eligibility	after	inadvertent	overborrowing	may	or	may	not	be	eligible	to	receive	additional	loan funds,	depending	on	the	circumstances.	For	example,	a	dependent	undergraduate	who	inadvertently	exceeded	the $23,000	aggregate	limit	for	subsidized	loans	could	not	receive	any	additional	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	as	a dependent	undergraduate	unless	the	outstanding	debt	was	paid	down	below	the	$23,000	limit	(see	Chapter	4	of	this volume	for	information	on	aggregate	loan	limits).	However,	the	student	could	potentially	receive	additional	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	funds,	up	to	the	$31,000	aggregate	loan	limit,	or	non-loan	aid.	An	independent	undergraduate	who inadvertently	exceeded	the	$23,000	subsidized	limit	(but	who	has	not	reached	the	$57,500	combined	aggregate	loan	limit for	independent	undergraduates)	could	borrow	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	once	they	make	satisfactory arrangements	to	repay	the	subsidized	amount	that	exceeds	$23,000.	For	more	on	overborrowing	and	overawards,	see Volume	4.

A	student	who	regains	Title	IV	eligibility	after	having	inadvertently	exceeded	an	annual	loan	limit	for	an	academic	year	is not	eligible	to	receive	additional	Direct	Loan	funds	for	that	same	academic	year,	but	could	receive	other	types	of	Title	IV aid.	However,	if	the	student	exceeded	only	the	annual	subsidized	limit	and	has	regained	eligibility,	the	student	would	be eligible	to	receive	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	up	to	the	applicable	annual	maximum.

Note: A	student	who	inadvertently	exceeded	an	undergraduate	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limit	does	not automatically	become	eligible	to	receive	additional	Direct	Loans	if	they	become	eligible	for	an	increased	annual loan	limit	as	a	result	of	progressing	to	a	higher	grade	level,	or	if	they	become	eligible	for	a	higher	aggregate	loan limit	due	to	their	dependency	status	changing	from	dependent	to	independent	or	by	their	enrollment	in	a graduate	or	professional	degree	program.	In	either	case,	the	inadvertent	overborrowing	must	still	be	resolved before	the	student	can	receive	additional	Title	IV	aid.

## Repayment	of	the	Excess	Loan	Amount

If	a	student	who	has	inadvertently	overborrowed	wishes	to	regain	Title	IV	eligibility	by	repaying	the	excess	loan	amount, the	student	must	contact	the	applicable	servicer	and	comply	with	the	servicer9s	repayment	instructions.	The	school	may assist	the	student	in	identifying	and	contacting	the	servicer,	but	the	student,	not	the	school,	must	make	the	payment	of the	excess	loan	funds	in	accordance	with	the	servicer9s	instructions.	Once	the	student	has	repaid	the	excess	loan	amount in	full,	the	servicer	will	send	the	student	confirmation	that	the	excess	loan	amount	has	been	repaid.	The	student	or servicer	must	provide	a	copy	of	the	repayment	confirmation	to	the	school.	The	inadvertent	overborrowing	is	considered	to have	been	resolved	as	of	the	date	the	servicer	received	the	borrower9s	full	payment	of	the	excess	loan	amount.

## Satisfactory	Repayment	Arrangements	(&lt;Reaffirmation=)

A	student	who	has	inadvertently	overborrowed	may	also	regain	Title	IV	eligibility	by	making	satisfactory	repayment arrangements	to	repay	the	excess	loan	amount.	This	requirement	can	be	met	if	the	student	agrees	in	writing	to	repay	the excess	amount	according	to	the	terms	and	conditions	of	the	promissory	note	that	supported	the	loan.	This	is	called &lt;reaffirmation.=	The	reaffirmation	process	includes	the	following	five	steps:

- 1.	 Either	the	student	or	the	school	where	the	student	is	requesting	additional	Title	IV	funds	contacts	the	servicer	of	the loan	that	caused	the	overborrowing	and	explains	that	the	student	has	inadvertently	overborrowed	and	wishes	to reaffirm	the	debt.
- 2.	 The	servicer	sends	the	student	a	reaffirmation	agreement.
- 3.	 The	student	reads,	signs,	and	returns	the	reaffirmation	agreement	to	the	servicer.
- 4.	 The	servicer	sends	the	student	confirmation	that	the	reaffirmation	agreement	has	been	accepted.	The	student	or servicer	must	provide	a	copy	of	the	confirmation	to	the	school	where	the	student	is	requesting	Title	IV	funds.
- 5.	 The	inadvertent	overborrowing	is	considered	to	have	been	resolved	as	of	the	date	the	servicer	receives	the	student9s signed	reaffirmation	agreement.

Consolidation	of	Loan	Amounts	That	Exceed	the	Annual	or	Aggregate	Loan	Limit

If	a	borrower	who	inadvertently	received	more	than	the	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits	has	consolidated	the	loan(s)	that caused	the	borrower	to	exceed	the	loan	limit	into	a	Direct	Consolidation	Loan,	the	Direct	Consolidation	Loan	is	considered a	satisfactory	arrangement	to	repay	the	excess	amount.	This	restores	the	borrower9s	eligibility	for	Title	IV	aid.	If	the	school where	the	student	is	seeking	aid	confirms	through	NSLDS	that	the	loan(s)	have	been	consolidated,	no	further	action	is required.	Note,	however,	that	consolidation	of	an	amount	that	exceeded	the	combined	aggregate	loan	limit	for	Direct Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	does	not	automatically	make	a	student	eligible	for	additional	Direct	Loan funds.

If	you	choose	to	exercise	this	discretion,	you	must	ensure that	your	decisions	are	made	on	a	case-by-case	basis	and	do	not	constitute	a	pattern	or	practice	that	denies	access	to Direct	Loans	for	borrowers	because	of	race,	sex,	color,	income,	religion,	national	origin,	age,	or	disability	status.	When	you make	a	decision	not	to	originate	a	loan	or	to	reduce	the	amount	of	the	loan,	you	must	retain	documentation	supporting the	determination	in	the	student9s	file	and	provide	the	reason	for	the	determination	to	the	student	in	writing.

## Chapter	2 Direct	Loan	Counseling

## Counseling	Overview

First-time	student	borrowers	must	complete	entrance	counseling	before	they	can	receive	the	first	disbursement	of	a Direct	Loan,	and	all	student	Direct	Loan	borrowers	must	complete	exit	counseling	shortly	before	they	cease	to	be	enrolled on	at	least	a	half-time	basis.	There	is	a	special	counseling	requirement	for	student	and	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrowers who	meet	the	requirements	to	receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	after	having	been	determined	to	have	an	adverse	credit history.	This	chapter	discusses	the	counseling	requirements	for	Direct	Loan	borrowers	and	associated	school responsibilities.

## Entrance	Counseling

Entrance	counseling	is	required	for	all	first-time	student	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	and	student Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrowers.	Entrance	counseling	is	not	required	for	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrowers.

For	this	purpose,	a	first-time	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	borrower	is	someone	who	has	not received	a	prior	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	Subsidized	Federal	Stafford	Loan,	Unsubsidized	Federal Stafford	Loan,	or	Federal	Supplemental	Loans	for	Students	(SLS)	Loan.	In	the	case	of	a	graduate	or	professional	student who	requests	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	a	first-time	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrower	is	someone	who	has	not	received	a	prior	student Direct	PLUS	Loan	or	student	Federal	PLUS	Loan.	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Federal	Stafford	Loans,	Federal	SLS	Loans, and	Federal	PLUS	Loans	are	loan	types	that	were	made	under	the	Federal	Family	Education	Loan	(FFEL)	Program	before the	authority	to	make	new	FFEL	Program	loans	ended	effective	July	1,	2010.

Before	making	the	first	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	or	student	Direct	PLUS	Loan to	a	first-time	borrower,	you	must	ensure	that	the	student	receives	entrance	counseling.

Entrance	counseling	provides	borrowers	with	comprehensive	information	on	the	terms	and	conditions	of	the	loan	they	are about	to	receive,	and	their	responsibility	to	repay	the	loan.	This	information	may	be	provided	during	an	in-person counseling	session,	on	a	separate	written	form	that	the	borrower	signs	and	returns	to	the	school,	or	online	or	by interactive	electronic	means,	with	the	borrower	acknowledging	receipt	of	the	information.

If	entrance	counseling	is	conducted	online	or	through	interactive	electronic	means,	your	school	must	take	reasonable steps	to	ensure	that	students	finish	the	counseling,	which	may	include	completing	a	test	of	their	understanding	of	the terms	and	conditions	of	the	loan.	If	a	standardized,	interactive	electronic	tool	is	used	for	counseling,	you	must	give	the borrower	any	required	information	that	is	not	addressed	in	the	tool	either	in	person	or	in	a	separate	written	or	electronic document.

Your	school	must	have	someone	with	expertise	in	the	Title	IV	programs	reasonably	available	shortly	after	the	counseling to	answer	students9	questions.	As	an	alternative,	if	students	are	enrolled	in	an	approved	correspondence,	distance education,	or	study-abroad	program,	they	may	be	provided	with	written	counseling	materials	before	the	loan	is	disbursed.

You	may	not	require	students	to	complete	additional	counseling	beyond	entrance	counseling.	However,	your	entrance counseling	policy	can	require	more	than	the	minimum	specified	by	the	regulations	as	long	as	the	additional	requirements are	reasonable	as	to	time,	effort,	and	relevance	to	the	students9	borrowing	and	are	not	administered	in	a	way	that unreasonably	impedes	students9	ability	to	receive	Direct	Loans	in	a	timely	manner.	For	example,	your	entrance	counseling can	include	one	or	more	of	the	following:

- Extra	information	as	part	of	in-person	individual	or	group	training	or	through	your	website,	other	electronic	means, written	materials,	or	different	methods;
- A	requirement	for	first-time	student	borrowers	to	take	a	test	or	evaluation	of	what	they	learned	in	counseling	(though you	cannot	establish	a	passing	score	that	they	must	achieve	to	get	a	Direct	Loan);
- A	requirement	for	students	to	complete	a	worksheet,	budget,	or	other	exercise	designed	to	improve	financial	literacy and	understanding	of	the	implications	of	borrowing	(but	you	cannot	require	them	to	justify	the	need	for	a	loan);	or
- A	requirement	for	students	to	participate	in	a	workshop,	loan	orientation	presentation,	or	similar	activity.

You	cannot	require,	but	you	can	encourage	borrowers	to	participate	in	counseling	beyond	entrance	counseling	to	be better	informed	about	borrowing,	the	terms	of	their	Direct	Loans,	their	repayment	responsibilities	and	options,	and	the consequences	of	default.	Your	school	can	also	offer	financial	literacy	classes,	on	a	credit	or	non-credit	basis,	that	include information	on	budgeting,	debt	management,	anticipated	earnings	by	profession,	elements	of	loan	counseling,	etc., though	eligibility	for	a	Direct	Loan	cannot	be	contingent	on	completion	of	such	a	class.

Required	Entrance	Counseling	Content	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Borrowers

Below	we	provide	a	summary	of	the	information	that	must	be	covered	in	entrance	counseling	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loan and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	borrowers.	For	more	detailed	information,	refer	to	the	regulations	cited	at	the	end	of	this section.

Entrance	counseling	for	Direct	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	loan	borrowers	must:

- Explain	the	use	of	a	Master	Promissory	Note	(MPN);
- Emphasize	the	importance	of	the	loan	repayment	obligation;
- Describe	the	likely	consequences	of	default,	including	adverse	credit	reports,	delinquent	debt	collection	procedures under	Federal	law,	and	litigation;
- Emphasize	that	the	borrower	must	repay	the	full	amount	of	the	loan	even	if	the	borrower	does	not	complete	the program,	does	not	complete	the	program	within	the	regular	time	for	program	completion,	is	unable	to	obtain employment	upon	completion,	or	is	otherwise	dissatisfied	with	or	does	not	receive	the	educational	or	other	services that	the	student	paid	for	with	the	loan;
- Inform	the	student	borrower	of	sample	monthly	repayment	amounts	based	on	a	range	of	student	levels	of indebtedness	depending	on	the	types	of	loans	the	borrower	has	received,	or	based	on	the	average	indebtedness	of other	borrowers	in	the	same	program	at	the	same	school;
- Explain	how	accepting	the	loan	will	affect	the	borrower9s	eligibility	for	other	forms	of	student	financial	assistance;
- Provide	information	on	how	interest	accrues	and	is	capitalized	during	periods	when	the	interest	is	not	paid	by	either the	borrower	or	the	Department;
- Inform	the	borrower	of	the	option	to	pay	the	interest	on	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	while	the	borrower	is	in	school;
- Explain	the	definition	of	half-time	enrollment	at	the	school	and	the	consequences	of	not	maintaining	half-time enrollment;
- Explain	the	importance	of	contacting	the	appropriate	offices	at	the	school	if	the	borrower	withdraws	before

completing	their	program	of	study	so	that	the	school	can	provide	exit	counseling;

- Provide	information	on	how	the	borrower	can	access	their	records	in	the	National	Student	Loan	Data	System (NSLDS);	and
- Provide	the	name	of	the	individual	the	borrower	may	contact	if	the	borrower	has	questions	about	the	borrower9s rights	and	responsibilities	or	the	terms	and	conditions	of	the	loan.

Required	Content	for	Student	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Entrance	Counseling

## Exit	Counseling

A	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	or	student	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrower	who	is	graduating,	leaving school,	or	dropping	below	half-time	enrollment	is	required	to	complete	exit	counseling.	If	the	student	withdraws	without notifying	your	school,	you	must	confirm	that	they	have	completed	online	counseling	or	mail	exit	counseling	material	to the	student	at	their	last	known	address.	You	may	also	email	the	information	to	the	student9s	home	(not	school)	email address	if	you	have	it.	The	PDF	version	of	the	Direct	Loan	Exit	Counseling	Guide	satisfies	this	requirement.	You	may	also send	the	student	a direct	link to	the	exit	counseling	materials	online.	Whatever	method	you	choose	must	be	used	within 30	days	of	learning	that	the	borrower	has	withdrawn	or	failed	to	participate	in	an	exit	counseling	session.

When	mailing	exit	materials	to	a	student	who	has	left	school,	you9re	not	required	to	use	certified	mail	with	a	return	receipt requested,	but	you	must	document	in	their	file	that	the	materials	were	sent.	If	they	don9t	provide	updated	contact information,	you	don9t	need	to	take	further	action.

The	required	content	of	exit	counseling	is	summarized	in	the	section	that	follows.	For	more	detailed	information,	refer	to the	regulations	cited	at	the	end	of	the	section.

## Required	Exit	Counseling	Content

## Exit	counseling	must:

- Inform	the	student	borrower	of	the	average	anticipated	monthly	repayment	amount	based	on	the	student	borrower9s indebtedness	or	on	the	average	indebtedness	of	student	borrowers	who	have	received	Direct	Loans	for	attendance at	the	same	school	or	in	the	same	program	of	study	at	the	same	school;
- Review	all	available	Direct	Loan	repayment	plan	options,	including	a	description	of	the	different	features	of	each	plan and	sample	information	showing	the	average	anticipated	monthly	payments,	and	the	difference	in	interest	paid	and total	payments	under	each	plan;
- Explain	the	options	to	prepay	each	loan,	to	pay	each	loan	on	a	shorter	schedule,	and	to	change	repayment	plans;
- Provide	information	on	the	effects	of	loan	consolidation;

- Explain	to	the	borrower	how	to	contact	their	loan	servicer;
- Explain	the	use	of	an	MPN;
- Emphasize	the	importance	of	the	loan	repayment	obligation;
- Emphasize	that	the	borrower	must	repay	the	full	amount	of	the	loan	even	if	the	borrower	does	not	complete	the program,	does	not	complete	the	program	within	the	regular	time	for	program	completion,	is	unable	to	obtain employment	upon	completion,	or	is	otherwise	dissatisfied	with	or	does	not	receive	the	educational	or	other	services that	the	student	paid	for	with	the	loan;
- Describe	the	likely	consequences	of	default;
- Provide	a	general	description	of	the	terms	and	conditions	under	which	a	borrower	may	obtain	full	or	partial forgiveness	or	discharge	of	a	loan,	defer	repayment	of	a	loan,	or	be	granted	forbearance	on	a	loan;
- Provide	a	copy,	either	in	print	or	by	electronic	means,	of	the	information	the	Department	makes	available	in accordance	with	section	485(d)	of	the	HEA	(see	below);
- Review	information	on	the	availability	of	the	Department9s	Student	Loan	Ombudsman9s	office;
- Inform	the	borrower	of	the	availability	of	Title	IV	loan	information	in	NSLDS	and	how	NSLDS	can	be	used	to	obtain Title	IV	loan	status	information;
- Inform	the	borrower	that	(1)	they	may	be	contacted	during	the	repayment	period	by	third-party	student	debt	relief companies;	(2)	the	borrower	should	use	caution	when	dealing	with	those	companies;	and	(3)	the	services	typically

provided	by	those	companies	are	already	offered	free	of	charge	through	the	Department	or	the	borrower's	loan servicer;

- Provide	a	general	description	of	the	types	of	tax	benefits	that	may	be	available	to	borrowers	(i.e.	student	loan interest	deduction);	and

## Required	Content	for	Exit	Counseling

## 34	CFR	685.304(b)(4)

As	stated	above,	Direct	Loan	exit	counseling	must	provide	borrowers	with	the	information	the	Department	makes available	in	accordance	with	section	485(d)	of	the	HEA.	This	section	of	the	law	requires	the	Department	to	make	available to	postsecondary	schools	and	other	entities	a	wide	variety	of	information	about	federal	student	assistance	programs, including	information	to	help	students	assess	the	debt	burden	and	repayment	obligations	that	will	be	incurred	as	a	result of	receiving	Title	IV	loans.	As	noted	below	under	&lt;Counseling	Methods,=	documentation	that	a	borrower	has	completed	the Department9s	online	exit	counseling	fully	satisfies	all	Direct	Loan	exit	counseling	requirements.	Schools	that	choose	to conduct	their	own	exit	counseling	can	meet	the	requirement	to	provide	borrowers	with	the	information	made	available	by the	Department	in	accordance	with	section	485(d)	of	the	HEA	by	providing	borrowers	with	a	copy	of	the	Department9s Direct	Loan	Exit	Counseling	Guide.

## Providing	Borrower	Information	at	Separation

Schools	that	conduct	their	own	exit	counseling	must	provide	the	current	personal	information	collected	from	the	student (name,	address,	references,	etc.)	to	students9	loan	servicers	within	60	days.	Students	authorize	their	school	to	release information	to	servicers	in	the	loan	promissory	note	they	signed.	No	further	permission	is	needed.

Students	who	complete	online	exit	counseling	on	the	Department9s	StudentAid.gov	website	fulfill	this	requirement	as	part of	the	counseling	session;	NSLDS	provides	the	information	to	the	loan	holders.

## Counseling	Methods

The	Department	offers	Direct	Loan	Program	online	entrance	and	exit	counseling	for	students	on	the	StudentAid.gov website.	Your	school	will	receive	notification	through	the	Student	Aid	Internet	Gateway	(SAIG)	(see	&lt;Required	Electronic Processes=	in	Volume	2,	Chapter	3	for	more	information)	of	online	loan	counseling	completed	by	borrowers,	and completion	information	can	also	be	viewed	on	the	COD	System	website.	If	your	school	documents	that	borrowers	have completed	the	Department9s	online	counseling,	it	has	satisfied	its	counseling	responsibility.	Documentation	that	a borrower	has	completed	the	Department9s	online	entrance	or	exit	counseling	fully	satisfies	all	Direct	Loan	entrance	or	exit counseling	requirements.

Your	school	may	also	choose	to	provide	entrance	or	exit	counseling	through	an	in-person	session	or	(for	entrance counseling)	by	providing	a	separate	written	form	to	the	student	that	the	student	signs	and	returns	to	the	school.	If	your school	conducts	in-person	counseling	sessions,	charts,	handouts,	audiovisual	materials,	and	question-and-answer	sessions can	help	convey	the	information	in	a	more	dynamic	manner.	We	also	recommend	the	use	of	written	tests	or	interactive programs	to	ensure	that	students	understand	the	terms	and	conditions	of	their	loans.	Counseling	materials,	such	as	the entrance	and	exit	counseling	guides,	are	available	in	the	Financial	Aid	Toolkit.

A	school	may	adopt	an	alternative	approach	for	entrance	counseling	as	a	part	of	its	quality	assurance	plan.	For	more information,	see	the	regulation	cited	below.

Regardless	of	the	counseling	methods	your	school	uses,	it	must	document	that	the	student	received	entrance	and	exit counseling,	and	it	must	ensure	that	an	individual	with	expertise	in	the	Title	IV	programs	is	reasonably	available	shortly after	the	counseling	to	answer	the	student9s	questions.

## Alternative	Approach	for	Entrance	Counseling

## 34	CFR	685.304(a)(8)

## Counseling	for	Correspondence	and	Study	Abroad	Students

If	a	first-time	student	borrower	has	enrolled	in	a	study-abroad	program	(approved	by	a	U.S.	school	for	credit)	or	a correspondence	or	distance	learning	program,	the	school	must	document	that	the	student	has	completed	online	entrance counseling	that	meets	the	regulatory	Direct	Loan	entrance	counseling	requirements	or	provide	written	entrance counseling	information	by	mail	or	email	before	making	the	first	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan	to	the	student.

In	the	case	of	exit	counseling	for	correspondence	programs	or	study	abroad	programs,	the	school	may	mail	or	email	the borrower	written	counseling	materials	within	30	days	after	the	borrower	completes	the	program,	with	a	request	that	they provide	the	contact	and	personal	information	that	would	ordinarily	have	been	collected	through	the	counseling	process.

## Providing	Additional	Information

Your	school	can	take	additional	steps	to	counsel	students,	such	as	assisting	them	with	developing	a	budget,	estimating need	for	loans,	and	planning	for	repayment.	You	can	also	reinforce	messages	to	borrowers.	For	example,	with	each disbursement	you	can	remind	students	about	the	importance	of	maintaining	satisfactory	academic	progress	(SAP;	see Volume	1,	Chapter	1	for	details	on	SAP	requirements),	planning	for	future	employment,	and	staying	in	touch	with	the	loan servicer.	Sample	measures	for	loan	counseling	are	given	in	the	&lt;Sample	Default	Prevention	Plan=	that	can	be	found	in	the regulations	cited	below.

Sample	Default	Prevention	Plan https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-VI/part-668/subpart-N/appendix-Appendix	A	to	Subpart	N of	Part	668"&gt;34	CFR	668	Subpart	N,	Appendix	A

## PLUS	Loan	Credit	Counseling

Special	loan	counseling	is	required	for	any	student	or	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	who	has	been	determined	to have	an	adverse	credit	history,	but	who	qualifies	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	either	by	getting	a	loan	endorser	or	by documenting	to	the	satisfaction	of	the	Department	that	there	are	extenuating	circumstances	related	to	the	adverse credit.	While	the	special	PLUS	Loan	Credit	Counseling	is	mandatory	only	for	these	borrowers,	any	PLUS	borrower	can voluntarily	complete	this	counseling.	See	Chapter	1	of	this	volume	for	more	information	about	adverse	credit.

Note	that	the	special	counseling	described	above	is	separate	from	the	entrance	counseling	that	all	first-time	graduate	and professional	student	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrowers	must	complete,	as	described	earlier	in	this	chapter.

## Annual	Student	Loan	Acknowledgement

The	Department	offers	a	tool	on	the	StudentAid.gov	website	called	the	Annual	Student	Loan	Acknowledgement.	The

Annual	Student	Loan	Acknowledgement	allows	student	and	parent	borrowers	to	view	how	much	they	currently	owe	in federal	student	loans	and	acknowledge	that	they	have	seen	this	amount.	Although	it	is	not	required,	the	Department continues	to	encourage	borrowers	to	complete	an	Annual	Student	Loan	Acknowledgement	each	year	they	accept	a	new Direct	Loan	to	help	them	understand	their	loans	and	how	those	loans	will	affect	their	financial	future.

Schools	will	receive	information	through	the	COD	System	about	a	borrower9s	optional	completion	of	the	Annual	Student Loan	Acknowledgment	process.	However,	the	COD	System	will	not	reject	disbursement	records	submitted	for	a	borrower who	has	not	completed	the	Annual	Student	Loan	Acknowledgment.

## Chapter	3

## Direct	Loan	Origination,	Loan	Periods,	and	Disbursements

## Origination	Overview

Origination	is	the	process	of	creating	a	Direct	Loan	award	in	the	school9s	system.	Before	originating	a	Direct	Loan,	a school	must	determine	the	student9s	or	parent9s	eligibility	for	the	loan.	For	each	Direct	Loan	that	a	school	disburses	to	a student	or	parent,	the	school	must	submit	a	loan	award	record	to	the	COD	System	that	includes	the	student9s	grade	level, the	loan	period	and	academic	year	dates,	the	loan	amount,	the	anticipated	and	actual	dates	and	amounts	of	the	loan disbursements,	and	other	information.	Submission	of	a	loan	award	record	serves	as	the	school9s	certification	that	it	has determined	the	borrower9s	eligibility	for	the	loan.

The	specific	Direct	Loan	amount	that	a	student	or	parent	borrower	is	eligible	to	receive	is	determined	based	on	various factors	such	as	the	student9s	COA,	Student	Aid	Index	(SAI),	OFA,	and	remaining	eligibility	under	the	annual	and	aggregate loan	limits	(see	Chapter	4	for	guidance	on	annual	and	aggregate	loan	limits).	Some	of	these	factors	are	relevant	only when	determining	eligibility	for	certain	types	of	Direct	Loans.	When	originating	a	Direct	Loan,	the	COA	used	in determining	the	loan	amount	may	include	only	those	costs	associated	with	the	period	of	enrollment	(loan	period)	for which	the	loan	is	being	originated.

Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	have	annual	and	aggregate	limits	that	are	the	same	for	all students	at	a	given	grade	level	and	dependency	status.	You	may	not	originate	a	Direct	Loan	for	an	amount	that:

- Exceeds	the	amount	requested	by	the	borrower;
- In	the	case	of	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	exceeds	the	student9s	COA	minus	the	student9s	SAI	and	OFA;
- In	the	case	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	or	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	exceeds	the	student9s	COA	minus	OFA;	or
- In	the	case	of	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	would	cause	the	student	to	exceed	the	annual	or aggregate	limit.

See	Volume	3,	Chapter	3	for	more	information	on	packaging	Direct	Loans	as	part	of	a	student9s	financial	aid	award.

## Originating	a	Loan

It9s	important	to	remember	that	your	school,	not	the	Department,	is	responsible	for	determining	a	borrower9s	eligibility	for a	Direct	Loan.	Schools	that	originate	and	disburse	loans	to	ineligible	borrowers,	or	for	loan	amounts	that	exceed	loan limits	or	financial	need,	are	subject	to	administrative	actions	such	as	a	fine,	limitation,	suspension,	and	termination,	as well	as	liabilities	including	repayment	to	the	government	of	interest	and	costs	it	has	paid	on	the	ineligible	loans.

You	must	originate	a	Direct	Loan	while	the	student	is	enrolled	and	eligible	for	the	period	of	enrollment	for	which	the	loan is	intended.	You	may	not	originate	a	loan	for	a	period	in	which	the	student	is	no	longer	enrolled.	For	example,	you	may not	originate	a	loan	for	a	prior	academic	year	that	has	ended,	even	if	the	student	is	enrolled	and	eligible	for	the	current academic	year.	Similarly,	if	a	student	who	was	enrolled	at	least	half	time	only	for	the	fall	and	spring	quarters	of	an academic	year	consisting	of	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters	does	not	request	a	loan	until	the	spring,	you	may	not	at	that time	originate	a	loan	for	the	previous	fall	quarter.

For	all	Direct	Loans,	you	must	document	the	student9s	COA,	SAI,	and	OFA	in	the	student9s	file.	This	information	must	be made	available	to	the	Department	upon	request.

You	must	confirm	that	the	borrower	meets	the	definition	of	eligible	borrower	by	doing	the	following:

- Determine	that	the	student	is	enrolled	at	least	half	time	and	making	satisfactory	academic	progress	(see	Volume	1);
- Review	the	NSLDS	information	on	the	ISIR	or	the	NSLDS	Professional	Access	website	to	ensure	that	the	student	is	not in	default,	does	not	owe	an	overpayment	on	a	Title	IV	grant	or	loan	(see	Volume	1),	and	will	not	exceed	the	annual	or aggregate	loan	limits	(as	described	in	Chapter	4	of	this	volume);
- Ensure	that	the	amount	of	the	loan,	in	combination	with	other	aid,	will	not	exceed	the	student9s	financial	need	or

COA	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	3);

- For	parents	receiving	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	ensure	that	the	student	has	completed	a	FAFSA	form	(review	the	student9s ISIR	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary);	and
- Ensure	that	the	loan	disbursement	dates	meet	cash	management	and	disbursement	requirements.

For	a	Direct	Subsidized/Unsubsidized	Loan,	you	must	also:

- Determine	the	student9s	Pell	Grant	eligibility	and,	if	they	are	eligible,	include	the	grant	in	the	student9s	aid	package;
- For	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	made	to	an	undergraduate	student,	first	determine	the	student9s	eligibility	for	a Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and,	if	the	student	is	eligible,	include	the	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	in	the	student9s	aid	package;
- Ensure	that	the	amount	of	the	loan	will	not	exceed	the	student9s	annual	or	aggregate	loan	limits;	and
- Prorate	the	annual	loan	limit	for	an	undergraduate	enrolled	in	a	program	or	remaining	period	of	study	that	is	shorter than	an	academic	year	(as	described	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume).

No	Alternate	SAI	When	Originating	Loans	for	Periods	Other	Than	Nine	Months

If	you	originate	a	Direct	Loan	for	a	period	shorter	than	a	full	academic	year	(for	example,	a	loan	for	a	single	term	or	for	a program	shorter	than	an	academic	year),	the	loan	amount	must	be	based	on	the	reduced	costs	for	that	shorter	period	of enrollment	rather	than	the	costs	for	the	full	academic	year.	However,	as	explained	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	3,	there	are	no alternate	SAIs	for	periods	of	enrollment	other	than	nine	months	comparable	to	the	alternate	EFCs	for	periods	other	than nine	months	that	were	used	prior	to	the	2024-2025	award	year.	In	all	cases	you	must	use	the	student9s	full	calculated	9month	SAI	in	the	formula	to	determine	financial	need	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	other	need-based	aid	even	though the	COA	will	reflect	the	reduced	costs	for	the	shorter	loan	period.	This	means	that	students	enrolled	for	periods	shorter than	nine	months	will	have	less	financial	need	than	would	have	been	the	case	in	the	past	when	using	a	smaller	alternate EFC,	because	now	the	full	calculated	SAI	must	be	subtracted	from	the	reduced	COA	for	the	shorter	period	of	enrollment when	determining	financial	need	for	purposes	of	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility.

Volume	8,	Chapter	3,	Example	1:	Effect	of	No	Alternate	SAI	on	Financial	Need	When	Originating	Loans	for	Periods Less	Than	Nine	Months

A	first-year	dependent	student	has	a	COA	of	$10,800	for	an	academic	year	consisting	of	the	fall	and	spring semesters	and	an	SAI	of	8,000,	so	the	student9s	financial	need	for	the	fall-spring	enrollment	period	is	$2,800	(see Volume	3,	Chapter	3	for	guidance	on	determining	financial	need).	The	student	is	not	eligible	for	a	Pell	Grant	and receives	no	Title	IV	aid	except	for	Direct	Loans.	The	student	qualifies	for	a	$2,800	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	to	fully cover	their	financial	need.	(The	student	could	also	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	but	for	purposes	of	this example	we	cover	only	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility.)

The	student	will	also	be	enrolled	for	the	summer	term,	which	the	school	treats	as	a	&lt;trailer=	to	the	preceding	fallspring	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY)	for	purposes	of	monitoring	annual	loan	limits	(see	Chapter	6	of	this Volume).	The	summer	term	is	four	months	in	length	and	the	COA	for	that	term	is	$4,000.	For	students	who	attend the	summer	term	and	request	Direct	Loan	funds,	the	school9s	normal	practice	is	to	originate	a	separate	loan	for the	summer	term	only.	Because	there	is	no	alternate	SAI	for	periods	of	enrollment	less	than	nine	months	and	the student9s	SAI	of	8,000	is	greater	than	the	summer	term	COA,	the	student	has	no	financial	need	for	summer	and	is therefore	ineligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	for	that	term	(but	could	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan).

As	an	alternative	to	originating	a	separate	summer-only	loan,	the	school	could	choose	to	originate	a	single	loan for	a	loan	period	covering	the	fall-spring	SAY	plus	the	summer	trailer	term.	The	student9s	COA	for	that	period	of enrollment	is	$14,800.	Subtracting	the	student9s	SAI	of	8,000	from	the	COA	results	in	financial	need	of	$6,800. The	student	would	therefore	be	eligible	to	receive	a	$3,500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	(the	maximum	subsidized annual	loan	limit	for	a	dependent	first-year	student)	for	the	fall-spring-summer	loan	period.

## No	Minimum	Direct	Loan	Amount	in	COD	System

The	COD	System	does	not	set	a	minimum	amount	for	which	a	school	may	originate	a	Direct	Loan.

## Sequestration

The	Budget	Control	Act	(BCA)	put	into	place	an	automatic	federal	budget	cut	known	as	the	sequester.	For	loans	made under	the	Direct	Loan	program,	the	sequester	requires	an	increase	in	the	amount	of	the	loan	fee	(also	known	as	the origination	fee)	that	is	charged	to	borrowers.	For	details	on	the	sequester-required	changes	to	Direct	Loan	origination fees,	see	the	April	30,	2024	Electronic	Announcement.

## Reporting	Loan	Information	Changes

It's	important	for	schools	to	accurately	report	academic	year	dates	and	loan	period	dates	for	all	types	of	Direct	Loans	to the	COD	System.	You	must	also	update	a	loan9s	previously	reported	loan	period	dates	or	academic	year	dates	if	the borrower9s	actual	attendance	is	different	from	the	anticipated	dates	that	were	the	basis	for	an	initial	reporting	to	the	COD System.	Other	circumstances	when	you	must	update	loan	data	in	the	COD	System	include:

- When	the	borrower	requests	the	cancellation	of	a	loan	or	a	loan	disbursement;
- When	the	borrower	does	not	begin	attendance,	or	does	not	begin	attendance	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis,	in	a payment	period	that	was	included	in	the	originally	reported	loan	period	and	you	did	not	make	any	disbursements	for that	payment	period	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	information	on	payment	periods);
- When	you	determine	that	the	borrower	is	not	eligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	for	a	payment	period	that	was	part	of the	originally	reported	loan	period	(for	example,	due	to	the	borrower9s	failure	to	meet	SAP	standards,	because	the borrower	has	an	overpayment,	or	because	a	change	in	circumstances	makes	the	borrower	ineligible	for	a	subsidized loan);
- When	the	borrower	withdraws	during	a	payment	period	that	was	included	in	the	originally	reported	loan	period,	and as	a	result,	the	entire	amount	of	the	loan	that	was	intended	for	that	payment	period	is	returned	under	the	Return	of Title	IV	Funds	(R2T4)	calculation;
- For	clock-hour	programs,	non-term	credit-hour	programs,	and	certain	types	of	nonstandard	term	credit-hour programs,	when	the	borrower	fails	to	progress	to	the	next	payment	period	or	academic	year	as	scheduled.

Note: In	limited	circumstances,	it	is	not	necessary	to	adjust	the	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	if	the	borrower	is	ineligible to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	during	one	or	more	terms	within	the	loan	period	due	to	not	being	enrolled	or	being	enrolled	on	a less-than-half-time	basis.	For	details,	see	&lt;Loan	Periods=	later	in	this	chapter.

Correcting	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Awarding	Errors

If	you	discover	that,	due	to	an	error,	a	student	borrower	has	received	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	in	excess	of	their financial	need,	and	the	student	is	still	enrolled	for	the	loan	period,	you	must	return	the	subsidized	loan	amount	for	which the	student	was	ineligible	and	ask	the	student	if	they	wish	to	replace	the	subsidized	funds	with	a	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan.	If	the	student	agrees	to	accept	the	unsubsidized	loan	funds	and	they	also	received	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for the	same	loan	period	as	the	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	you	may	increase	the	amount	of	the	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan disbursements	by	the	amount	of	the	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	that	the	student	was	ineligible	to	receive.	If	the	student	did not	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	you	may	originate	a	new	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	the	amount	of	the	Direct Subsidized	Loan	that	the	student	was	ineligible	to	receive.	The	new	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	must	have	the	same	loan period	and	disbursement	dates	as	the	Direct	Subsidized	Loan.

If	the	student	does	not	agree	to	have	the	excess	subsidized	loan	funds	replaced	by	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	you	must still	return	the	ineligible	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	amount.

If	you	discover	that	a	student	received	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	in	excess	of	financial	need	after	the	student	is	no longer	enrolled	for	the	loan	period,	you	are	not	required	to	take	any	action	to	eliminate	the	excess	subsidized	loan amount.

If	you	discover	that,	due	to	an	error,	a	student	borrower	who	was	eligible	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	instead	received	a Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	you	must	correct	the	error	(even	if	the	loan	period	has	ended)	by	submitting	a	downward adjustment	to	reduce	or	eliminate	the	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	as	appropriate,	and	replacing	it	with	the	same	amount	of Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds.	You	may	do	this	either	by	adjusting	an	existing	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	upwards,	or,	if	the student	does	not	have	an	existing	Direct	Subsidized	Loan,	by	originating	a	new	Direct	Subsidized	Loan.	Replacing	a	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	with	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	in	this	circumstance	does	not	require	obtaining	the	student9s	consent.

## Direct	Loan	Overawards

As	explained	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	3,	an	overaward	exists	when	a	student9s	aid	package	exceeds	their	need	or	overall COA.	If	you	discover	that	a	student	who	received	Direct	Loans	has	been	overawarded	and	your	school	has	already received	and	disbursed	some	or	all	of	the	Direct	Loan	funds,	you	have	the	following	options:

- If	the	student9s	aid	package	includes	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	or	a	nonfederal	education	loan, and	the	aid	package	doesn9t	already	apply	these	loans	toward	the	student9s	SAI,	you	may	choose	to	adjust	the	aid package	to	have	all	or	a	portion	of	these	loans	replace	the	SAI,	thus	reducing	or	eliminating	the	overaward	(for	more detail	and	examples,	see	&lt;Substituting	for	the	SAI=	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	3).
- If	you	have	not	yet	made	the	second	or	subsequent	disbursement	of	a	Direct	Loan,	you	can	reduce	or	cancel	the second	or	subsequent	disbursement.

If	the	overaward	situation	occurs	after	the	full	amount	of	a	Direct	Loan	has	been	disbursed,	you	do	not	need	to	adjust	the amount	of	the	loan.	However,	you	might	have	to	adjust	the	aid	package	to	prevent	an	overaward	of	Campus-Based	funds or	to	prevent	the	total	aid	package	from	exceeding	the	student9s	need.

Although	a	school	isn9t	required	to	return	Direct	Loan	funds	that	were	disbursed	to	the	borrower	(either	directly	or	by applying	them	to	the	student's	account)	before	the	overaward	situation	occurred,	the	law	doesn9t	prevent	your	school from	returning	funds	that	were	applied	to	the	student	account	if	you	choose	to	do	so.	A	borrower	who	receives	a	direct payment	of	loan	funds	is	not	required	to	repay	an	overawarded	amount,	unless	the	overaward	was	caused	by	the borrower9s	misreporting	or	withholding	of	information.

## Loan	Periods

The	loan	period	(also	referred	to	as	the	&lt;period	of	enrollment=)	is	the	period	for	which	a	Direct	Loan	is	intended.	It	must coincide	with	an	academic	period	established	by	the	school	for	which	institutional	charges	are	generally	assessed	(e.g., semester,	trimester,	quarter,	length	of	the	student9s	program,	or	academic	year).	It9s	important	to	define	the	loan	period at	the	beginning	of	the	loan	awarding	process,	because	the	timing	and	amount	of	Direct	Loan	disbursements	are	tied	to the	loan	period.

Generally,	the	loan	period	may	not	include	terms	in	which	a	student	is	ineligible	(for	example,	if	the	student	is	not	enrolled during	a	particular	term	or	is	enrolled	less	than	half	time	during	a	term).	There	is	a	limited	exception	to	this	rule	if	the	loan period	begins	and	ends	with	a	term	in	which	the	student	is	eligible	for	Direct	Loans,	but	the	first	and	last	terms	of	the	loan period	are	separated	by	one	or	more	terms	in	which	the	student	is	ineligible.	For	example,	if	a	student	is	expected	to	be enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis	in	the	fall	and	spring	quarters	of	an	academic	year	consisting	of	the	fall,	winter,	and spring	quarters,	but	the	student	indicates	that	they	do	not	plan	to	attend	the	winter	quarter	(or	that	they	plan	to	be enrolled	on	a	less	than	half-time	basis	during	that	quarter),	the	school	may	still	originate	a	loan	for	a	loan	period	covering the	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters.	Of	course,	no	costs	associated	with	winter	quarter	may	be	included	in	the	student9s COA	when	determining	the	loan	amount	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	for	the	fall	and	spring	quarters.	Similarly,	if	a school	initially	originates	a	loan	for	a	fall-winter-spring	loan	period	based	on	a	student9s	anticipated	enrollment	status	of at	least	half	time	during	all	three	quarters,	but	the	student	subsequently	does	not	attend	the	winter	quarter	or	temporarily drops	below	half-time	status	for	that	term,	and	then	resumes	at	least	half-time	enrollment	in	the	spring,	the	school	is	not required	to	make	any	changes	to	the	original	fall-winter-spring	loan	period.	However,	it	may	be	necessary	for	the	school to	adjust	the	originally	approved	loan	amount	if	that	amount	is	no	longer	supported	by	the	reduced	costs	for	the	fall	and spring	quarters	only.

In	the	first	scenario	described	above	the	school	could	also	choose	to	originate	two	separate	loans	for	fall-only	and	springonly	loan	periods.	In	the	second	scenario	the	school	would	also	have	the	option	of	adjusting	the	original	fall-winter-spring loan	period	to	fall-only,	and	then	originating	a	new	spring-only	loan.	Note,	however,	that	in	both	cases	the	school	would then	be	required	to	separately	subtract	the	student9s	full	SAI	from	the	fall-only	and	spring-only	costs	when	determining the	student9s	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	eligibility	for	those	terms	(see	&lt;No	Alternate	SAI	When	Originating	Loans	for	Periods Other	Than	Nine	Months=	earlier	in	this	chapter).	In	some	cases	this	could	significantly	reduce	or	even	eliminate	a student9s	need	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.	In	contrast,	using	a	fall-winter-spring	loan	period	(excluding	all	costs associated	with	the	winter	quarter)	would	allow	the	school	to	subtract	the	full	SAI	from	the	higher	combined	costs	for	the fall	and	spring	terms,	partially	mitigating	the	effect	of	not	having	alternate	SAIs	for	periods	of	enrollment	other	than	nine months.

The	limited	exception	described	above	applies	only	if	a	student	is	eligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	during	the	first	and	last terms	within	the	loan	period.	The	term	in	which	the	student	is	ineligible	cannot	be	the	first	or	last	term	in	the	loan	period. For	instance,	a	school	may	not	originate	a	loan	for	a	fall-winter-spring	loan	period	if	the	student	does	not	attend	the	fall term	or	the	spring	term.

Note: See	the	guidance	at	the	end	of	this	chapter	for	certain	exceptions	to	the	normal	loan	period	rules	that	apply	when periods	of	clinical	work	are	included	in	a	standard	term.

## Period	of	Enrollment	(Loan	Period)	Definition

## 34	CFR	685.102(b)

## Minimum	Loan	Periods

The minimum period	for	which	a	school	may	originate	a	Direct	Loan	varies	depending	on	the	school9s	academic	calendar. As	explained	below	and	in	Chapter	7,	different	rules	apply	for	purposes	of	determining	the	minimum	loan	period	for	a Direct	Loan	and	the	type	of	academic	year	that	a	school	may	use	to	monitor	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limits	depending	on whether	a	program	is	term-based	(including	subscription-based	programs;	see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1)	with	either	standard or	nonstandard	terms,	or	is	a	non-term	program	(all	clock-hour	programs	are	treated	as	non-term	programs),	and	in	the case	of	a	term-based	program	with	nonstandard	terms,	depending	on	the	type	of	nonstandard	term,	as	described	below.

Nonstandard	terms	may	be	one	of	the	following	types:

|   2. | Nonstandard terms that are substantially equal, but one or more of the terms in the academic year contains fewer than nine weeks.                                        | Non- SE9W   |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|    3 | Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length (one or more of the terms in the academic year differs in length from another term by more than two weeks). | Non- SE9W   |

We	refer	to	the	first	type	of	nonstandard	term	as	&lt;SE9W=	nonstandard	terms.	We	group	the	second	and	third	types together	and	refer	to	them	as	&lt;non-SE9W=	nonstandard	terms.

Programs	with	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	are	treated	the	same	as	standard-term	programs	for	purposes	of	determining minimum	loan	period	length	and	monitoring	annual	loan	limits.	However,	programs	with	non-SE9W	nonstandard	terms	are treated	the	same	as	non-term	programs	for	these	purposes.

Note	that	substantially	equal	nonstandard	terms	(the	first	two	types	of	nonstandard	terms	described	above)	are	treated differently	for	purposes	of	determining	Direct	Loan	payment	periods	than	for	determining	minimum	loan	period	length and	monitoring	annual	loan	limits.	As	explained	in	Volume	1,	Chapter	1,	if	a	program	is	offered	in	standard	terms	or	in nonstandard	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	in	length	(regardless	of	the	length	of	the	nonstandard	term),	the	payment period	is	the	term.

However,	for	purposes	of	determining	the	minimum	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	and	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan limits,	substantially	equal	nonstandard	terms	that	contain	fewer	than	nine	weeks	are	treated	the	same	as	nonstandard terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal.	This	means	that	if	a	program	has	substantially	equal	nonstandard	terms	that	are less	than	nine	weeks	in	length,	you	must	make	a	Direct	Loan	disbursement	each	term	(the	same	as	would	be	the	case	if the	program	were	offered	in	standard	terms),	but	the	minimum	loan	period	and	the	type	of	academic	year	used	to monitor	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limits	must	be	determined	in	accordance	with	the	rules	that	apply	to	non-term	programs.

For	detailed	information	on	standard	term,	nonstandard	term,	and	non-term	programs,	see	Volume	1,	Chapter	1.

Minimum	Loan	Period

## 34	CFR	685.301(a)(10)(i)

Minimum	Loan	Period:	Standard	Term	and	SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Programs

For credit-hour	programs	with	standard	terms	(semesters,	quarters,	or	trimesters),	or	with	SE9W nonstandard	terms ,	the	minimum	loan	period	is	a	single	academic	term.	For	example,	if	a	student	will	be	enrolled	in	the fall	semester	only	and	will	skip	the	spring	semester,	you	may	originate	a	loan	with	a	loan	period	that	covers	only	the	fall term.

Minimum	Loan	Period:	Clock-Hour,	Non-Term,	and	Non-SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Programs

For all	other	programs	(i.e.,	clock-hour,	non-term,	and	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs) ,	the	minimum loan	period	is	generally	the	lesser	of	the	program	length	(or	remainder	of	the	program,	if	there	is	less	than	full	academic year	remaining)	or	the	academic	year.	There	are	exceptions	to	this	minimum	loan	period	rule	when	originating	loans	for transfer	students,	or	for	students	who	complete	or	otherwise	cease	enrollment	in	one	program	and	then	begin	a	different program	at	the	same	school.	We	discuss	these	exceptions	in	detail	in	Chapter	7	of	this	volume.

Minimum	Loan	Period:	Programs	Offered	in	Modules

If	a	program	is	offered	in	modules,	this	does	not	change	the	minimum	loan	period	rules	for	Direct	Loans.	For	example,	if	a standard	or	SE9W	nonstandard	term	is	divided	into	two	or	more	modules,	the	minimum	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	is still	the	term,	even	if	the	student	does	not	attend	all	modules	within	the	term.	Similarly,	if	a	clock-hour,	non-term	credit- hour,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	program	is	offered	in	modules,	the	minimum	loan	period	is	still	the	lesser	of	the academic	year	or	the	program	length	(or	remaining	portion	of	the	program).

For	Title	IV	aid	purposes,	students	are	allowed	to	skip	one	or	more	modules.	However,	if	a	loan	period	includes	modules that	the	student	does	not	attend,	the	COA	for	the	loan	period	may	not	include	costs	associated	with	those	modules.

Minimum	Loan	Period:	Standard	Term	Combined	With	an	Intersession

As	we	explain	under	&lt;Intersessions=	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	in	limited	cases	for	academic	programs	offered	in	standard terms,	a	short	nonstandard	term	(often	called	an	&lt;intersession=)	may	be	combined	with	a	preceding	or	following	standard term	and	considered	to	be	a	single	standard	term.	In	such	cases,	the	minimum	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	is	different depending	on	whether	a	student	attends	the	intersession.	If	a	student	who	attends	the	intersession	requests	a	loan	for	the combined	term,	the	loan	period	includes	the	standard	term	plus	the	intersession.	However,	if	the	student	attends	only	the standard	term	and	is	not	enrolled	in	the	intersession	that	is	attached	to	that	term,	the	loan	period	includes	only	the standard	term.

## Maximum	Loan	Periods

The maximum period	for	which	you	may	originate	a	Direct	Loan	is	generally	an	academic	year.	However,	if	your	school applies	the	annual	loan	limit	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	to	a	period	of	time	greater	than an	academic	year,	you	may	originate	a	Direct	Loan	for	that	longer	period	of	time.	For	example,	a	school	might	offer	an 1100	clock-hour	program	and	define	the	academic	year	as	900	clock	hours	but	could	choose	to	allow	students	to	receive just	one	annual	loan	limit	for	the	entire	1100-hour	program.	In	that	case,	the	loan	period	would	correspond	to	the	length of	the	program,	a	period	of	time	that	is	longer	than	the	academic	year.

In	this	section	we	discuss	certain other	disbursement	requirements	that	are	specific	to	the	Direct	Loan	Program.

Note: See	the	guidance	at	the	end	of	this	chapter	for	certain	exceptions	to	the	normal	Direct	Loan	disbursement requirements	that	apply	when	periods	of	clinical	work	are	included	in	a	standard	term.

Determining	Direct	Loan	Disbursement	Dates	and	Amounts

## 34	CFR	685.303(d)

## Requirement	for	Substantially	Equal	Disbursements

Direct	Loans	must	be	disbursed	in	substantially	equal	installments,	regardless	of	any	difference	in	costs	for	different payment	periods	that	are	within	the	same	loan	period,	and	no	Direct	Loan	disbursement	may	exceed	one-half	of	the	loan amount.

## Substantially	Equal	Disbursements

## 34	CFR	685.303(d)(5)

Direct	Loan	Disbursements	When	the	Loan	Period	is	a	Single	Payment	Period

As	explained	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1,	all	Title	IV	program	funds	(including	Direct	Loan	funds)	except	for	Federal	WorkStudy	payments	must	be	disbursed	on	a	payment	period	basis.	Except	in	certain	cases	for	Direct	Loans	made	to	cover	the costs	of	a	study	abroad	program	(see	below),	if	the	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	covers	more	than	one	payment	period,	a school	must	make	at	least	one	Direct	Loan	disbursement	in	each	payment	period.

If	the	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	is	a	single	payment	period,	a	school	must	generally	make	at	least	two	disbursements of	a	Direct	Loan	(see	below	for	two	exceptions	to	this	requirement).	The	following	requirements	apply	for	the	timing	of	the second	disbursement:

- For	credit-hour	programs	offered	in	standard	terms	or	offered	in	nonstandard	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	in length	with	no	term	less	than	nine	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	length,	the	second	disbursement	may	not	be	made until	the	calendar	midpoint	between	the	first	and	last	scheduled	days	of	class	in	the	loan	period.
- For	all	other	programs,	including	clock-hour	and	non-term	credit-hour	programs,	and	nonstandard	term	programs with	terms	that	are	not	substantially	equal	or	with	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	and	less	than	nine	weeks	of instructional	time	in	length,	the	second	disbursement	may	not	be	made	until	the	student	successfully	completes	half of	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	payment	period,	and	half	of	the	clock	or	credit	hours	in	the	payment	period.

Exceptions	to	the	Multiple	Disbursement	Requirement	When	the	Loan	Period	is	a	Single	Payment	Period

If	the	loan	period	is	not	more	than	one	semester,	one	trimester,	one	quarter	or,	for	non-term-based	schools	or	schools with	nonstandard	terms,	four	months,	a	school	with	a	cohort	default	rate	of	less	than	15%	for	each	of	the	three	most recent	fiscal	years	for	which	data	are	available	may	disburse	a	Direct	Loan	in	a	single	installment.

In	addition,	if	the	loan	period	is	a	single	payment	period	and	more	than	half	of	the	payment	period	has	elapsed	before	the school	has	made	a	disbursement,	the	school	may	include	in	the	disbursement	loan	proceeds	for	the	entire	payment period.

## Direct	Loan	Disbursements	for	Completed	Payment	Periods

The	Direct	Loan	Program	regulations	allow	a	school	to	include	in	a	single	disbursement	the	disbursements	for	any payment	periods	that	have	ended.	However,	the	COD	System	(except	for	schools	exempted	because	of	low	default	rates) requires	schools	to	enter	at	least	two	anticipated	disbursement	dates.	Therefore,	when	creating	a	loan	origination	record for	a	Direct	Loan	when	you	intend	to	include	in	a	disbursement	loan	proceeds	for	any	payment	periods	that	have	been completed,	you	should	enter	the	actual	date	you	anticipate	making	the	disbursement	as	the	anticipated	date	for	all disbursements	that	would	be	included.	For	example,	consider	a	school	attempting	to	submit	an	origination	when	the	data is	as	follows:

Loan	period:	09/01	-	05/30	(fall	through	spring)

Minimum	number	of	disbursements	normally	required:	2

Payment	period	1:	09/01	-	12/20

Payment	period	2:	01/06	-	05/30

Date	school	creates	origination	record:	01/09

If	you	anticipate	disbursing	the	loan	proceeds	for	both	payment	periods	on	January	16,	you	should	enter	January	16	as	the date	for	both	the	first	and	second	disbursements	when	you	create	the	origination	record.

Direct	Loan	Disbursement	After	One	or	More	Payment	Periods	Have	Elapsed

## 34	CFR	685.303(d)(4)(i)

## Direct	Loan	Disbursements	Made	After	the	Date	of	the	Borrower9s	Death

If	a	school	learns	that	a	student	or	parent	Direct	Loan	borrower	has	died	before	one	or	more	disbursements	of	a	loan	have been	made,	the	school	must	cancel	all	pending	disbursements.	Direct	Loan	funds	cannot	be	disbursed	when	there	is	no possibility	of	repayment.	In	addition,	if	a	school	is	not	informed	of	a	student	or	parent	borrower9s	death	until	after	one	or more	loan	disbursements	have	been	made,	the	school	must	return	to	the	Department	the	full	amount	of	all	loan	funds that	were	credited	to	the	student9s	school	account	after	the	date	of	the	borrower9s	death	(if	the	post-death	disbursement created	a	credit	balance	that	was	paid	directly	to	the	student	or	parent,	the	school	is	not	responsible	for	returning	the credit	balance	amount).

Disbursements	after	the	date	of	the	borrower9s	death	are	most	likely	to	occur	when	a	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrower dies.	If	an	enrolled	student	dies,	the	school	will	generally	learn	of	the	death	in	a	timely	manner	and	can	cancel	any pending	loan	disbursements.	However,	if	a	parent	Direct	PLUS	Loan	borrower	dies,	the	student	or	other	family	members may	not	notify	the	school	or	the	loan	servicer	right	away,	particularly	if	the	parent	borrower	had	requested	a	deferment	of payments	while	the	student	was	enrolled	at	least	half	time.

If	a	school	is	required	to	return	Direct	PLUS	Loan	funds	that	were	disbursed	after	the	date	of	the	parent	borrower9s	death, the	school	should	determine	whether	there	is	a	surviving	parent	who	can	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	the	amount	of the	original	Direct	PLUS	loan	that	must	be	returned.	If	this	is	not	an	option,	the	school	may	award	additional	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	(up	to	the	amounts	normally	available	only	to	independent	undergraduates)	to	the	dependent student	(see	&lt;Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Independent	Undergraduates	and	Certain	Dependent	Undergraduates=	in	Chapter	4 of	this	volume).	In	this	specific	circumstance,	a	school	may	originate	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	a	surviving	parent	or	originate a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	for	the	dependent	student	even	if	the	loan	period	has	ended.

For	additional	guidance	on	other	actions	that	a	school	must	take	when	a	Title	IV	aid	recipient	dies,	see	Appendix	B	of	the FSA	Handbook.

Exceptions	to	the	Normal	Loan	Period	and	Disbursement	Requirements	When	Clinical	Work	is	Included	in	a	Standard	Term

Volume	3,	Chapter	1	of	the	FSA	Handbook	describes	standard	terms	(semesters,	quarters,	and	trimesters)	and nonstandard	terms,	and	explains	that	standard	terms	or	nonstandard	terms	that	are	substantially	equal	and	at	least	nine weeks	in	length	(&lt;SE9W=	nonstandard	terms)	may	not	include	periods	of	clinical	work,	such	as	medical	and	education program	work	which	is	conducted	outside	the	classroom,	unless	certain	requirements	are	met	(see	&lt;Inclusion	of	Clinical Work	in	a	Standard	Term=).	If	a	standard	term	or	SE9W	nonstandard	term	contains	clinical	work	that	meets	all	the	criteria to	be	included	in	the	term,	this	may	result	in	certain	exceptions	to	the	normal	loan	period	and	disbursement	rules	as discussed	earlier	in	this	chapter.	We	discuss	these	exceptions	below.

- If	clinical	work	meets	the	criteria	described	in	Volume	3	to	be	included	in	a	standard	term	or	SE9W	nonstandard term,	the	school	must	associate	the	clinical	work	with	the	term	during	which	the	majority	of	the	clinical	work	occurs. If	a	student	receives	a	Direct	Loan	for	a	term	that	includes	clinical	work	and	the	clinical	work	begins	before	the starting	date	of	the	term	with	which	the	clinical	work	is	associated,	the	loan	period	start	date	is	the	beginning	date	of the	clinical	work	(rather	than	the	starting	date	of	the	term,	as	would	normally	be	the	case).
- For	example,	if	a	school	originates	a	Direct	Loan	for	a	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY)	consisting	of	fall	and	spring semesters	that	run	from	September	1	through	May	31,	and	the	fall	semester	includes	clinical	work	that	begins	on August	15,	the	school	would	report	the	loan	period	dates	as	August	15	through	May	31.	If	the	clinical	work	does	not begin	until	on	or	after	the	starting	date	of	the	term	with	which	it	is	associated,	the	loan	period	start	date	would	be the	beginning	date	of	the	term.
- If	the	clinical	work	ends	after	the	ending	date	of	the	term	with	which	it	is	associated,	the	loan	period	end	date	for	a Direct	Loan	is	the	ending	date	of	the	clinical	work	(instead	of	the	ending	date	of	the	term,	as	would	normally	be	the case).
- For	example,	if	a	school	originates	a	Direct	Loan	for	a	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY)	consisting	of	fall	and	spring semesters	that	run	from	September	1	through	December	31	(fall)	and	January	1	through	May	31	(spring),	and	the spring	semester	includes	clinical	work	that	ends	on	June	20,	the	school	would	report	the	loan	period	dates	as September	1	through	June	20.	However,	if	the	clinical	work	ends	on	or	before	the	ending	date	of	the	term	with	which it	is	associated,	the	loan	period	end	date	would	be	the	ending	date	of	the	term.
- If	loan	period	dates	are	adjusted	as	explained	above	to	account	for	clinical	work	that	begins	before	or	ends	after	the normal	term	starting	and	ending	dates,	the	academic	year	period	to	which	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	applies, and	the	payment	period	dates	must	also	be	adjusted	accordingly.	Using	the	example	above	where	the	spring	term	of a	fall-spring	SAY	contains	clinical	work	that	ends	on	June	20,	and	assuming	that	the	annual	loan	limit	applies	to	that fall-spring	SAY	period,	the	school	would	report	the	academic	year	dates	associated	with	the	loan	as	September	1 through	June	20,	and	would	report	the	dates	of	the	second	payment	period	(the	spring	semester)	as	January	1 through	June	20	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	guidance	on	payment	periods,	and	Chapter	6	of	this	volume	for information	on	SAYs	and	monitoring	annual	loan	limits).
- If	there	are	two	consecutive	loan	periods	for	standard	terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	that	include	clinical	work, and	the	first	loan	period	has	not	ended	when	the	clinical	work	associated	with	the	next	loan	period	is	scheduled	to begin	(because	the	clinical	work	associated	with	the	term	has	not	yet	been	completed),	it	is	permissible	for	the	two loan	periods	(and	the	associated	payment	periods)	to	overlap.
- If	a	loan	period	includes	more	than	one	standard	or	SE9W	nonstandard	term,	the	second	or	subsequent	disbursement of	a	Direct	Loan	disbursement	normally	can	be	made	up	to	10	days	before	the	first	day	of	classes	of	the	second	or subsequent	term.	However,	if	a	second	or	subsequent	term	in	a	loan	period	includes	clinical	work	that	a	student	has not	yet	started	when	the	term	begins	(because	the	clinical	work	associated	with	that	term	does	not	start	until	some point	after	the	beginning	date	of	the	term),	the	second	or	subsequent	loan	disbursement	can	be	made	no	earlier than	10	days	before	the	beginning	of	the	clinical	work.	( Note: The	scenario	described	here	assumes	that	the	term includes	only	clinical	work.	If,	in	addition	to	the	clinical	work	that	starts	later,	the	term	also	includes	regular coursework	that	starts	on	the	beginning	date	of	the	term,	the	normal	early	disbursement	rules	apply	and	the	second or	subsequent	disbursement	can	be	made	up	to	10	days	before	the	first	day	of	classes	of	the	term.)

## Chapter	4

## Annual	and	Aggregate	Loan	Limits

## Annual	Loan	Limit	Overview

Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	have	annual	loan	limits	that	vary	based	on	the	student9s	grade level	and	(for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans)	dependency	status.	The	annual	loan	limits	are	the	maximum	amounts	that	a student	may	receive	for	an	academic	year.	The	actual	loan	amount	that	a	student	is	eligible	to	receive	may	be	less	than the	annual	loan	limit.	(There	are	also	aggregate	loan	limits	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans, discussed	later	in	this	chapter.)

There	are	higher	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limits	for	students	enrolled	in	certain	health	professions	programs, and	special	loan	limits	for	certain	students	who	are	not	enrolled	in	a	program	that	leads	to	a	degree	or	certificate	awarded by	the	school	they	are	attending.	Also,	the	annual	loan	limits	for	undergraduate	students	must	be	prorated	(reduced)	in some	cases.

Depending	on	the	academic	calendar	of	the	program,	a	student	who	has	reached	the	annual	loan	limit	cannot	receive another	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	until	they	either	begin	another	academic	year,	or,	in	some cases,	progress	within	an	academic	year	to	a	grade	level	with	a	higher	annual	loan	limit.

## Direct	Loan	Annual	Loan	Limits

## 34	CFR	685.203

## Annual	Loan	Limits:	Basic	Principles

- For	undergraduate	students,	there	is	a	combined	annual	loan	limit	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans,	of	which	not	more	than	a	specified	amount	may	be	comprised	of	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.
- For	graduate	or	professional	students,	the	annual	loan	limit	is	only	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.	Graduate	or professional	students	are	not	eligible	to	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.
- An	undergraduate	student	who	is	ineligible	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	may	receive	up	to	the	full	combined subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.
- The	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limits	are	the	same	for	both	dependent	and	independent	undergraduates.
- Dependent	students	have	lower	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limits	than	independent students.	However,	if	a	dependent	student9s	parent(s)	cannot	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	the	student	becomes eligible	for	the	higher	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limits	that	are	otherwise	available	only	to independent	students,	allowing	the	dependent	student	to	receive	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	(but	this does	not	change	the	student9s	dependency	status).
- The	annual	loan	limits	apply	to	the	academic	year	(that	is,	the	annual	loan	limit	is	the	maximum	loan	amount	that	a student	may	receive	for	one	academic	year).
- The	student9s	maximum	annual	loan	limit	increases	as	the	student	progresses	to	higher	grade	levels.
- For	undergraduate	students,	the	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	if	the	student	is	enrolled	in	a	program	(or	in	the remaining	portion	of	a	program)	that	is	less	than	an	academic	year	in	length.

Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Dependent	Undergraduates

For	dependent	undergraduate	students	(excluding	dependent	undergraduates	whose	parents	are	unable	to	obtain	Direct PLUS	Loans),	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limits	are	shown	in	Table	1A below.

The	&lt;Total	(Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized)=	limits	in	Table	1A	represent	the	total	of	all	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans	a	dependent	undergraduate	student	may	borrow	at	each	level	of	study	for	a	single	academic	year. For	example,	a	dependent	first-year	undergraduate	may	receive	up	to	$5,500	in	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and/or	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans	for	a	single	academic	year,	but	no	more	than	$3,500	of	this	amount	may	be	subsidized.	A	dependent first-year	undergraduate	who	has	no	subsidized	loan	eligibility	may	receive	up	to	the	full	$5,500	in	Direct	Unsubsidized Loans.

Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Independent	Undergraduates	and	Certain	Dependent	Undergraduates

The	maximum	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	amount	that	an	undergraduate	student	may	receive	each	academic	year	is	the same	for	both	dependent	and	independent	undergraduates.	However,	there	are	higher	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual loan	limits	for	independent	undergraduate	students	and	for	dependent	undergraduates	whose	parents	are	unable	to obtain	Direct	PLUS	Loans.	For	these	students,	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual loan	limits	are	shown	below	in	Table	1B.

As	with	the	loan	limits	for	dependent	undergraduates,	the	&lt;Total	(Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized)=	limits	represent	the	total of	all	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	that	an	independent	undergraduate	student	(or	a	dependent undergraduate	whose	parent	is	unable	to	obtain	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan)	may	borrow	at	each	level	of	study,	for	a	single academic	year.	For	example,	an	independent,	first-year	undergraduate	may	receive	up	to	$9,500	in	Direct	Subsidized Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	for	a	single	academic	year,	but	no	more	than	$3,500	of	this	amount	may	be subsidized.	An	independent	first-year	undergraduate	who	has	no	subsidized	loan	eligibility	may	receive	up	to	the	full $9,500	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds.

Although	a	dependent	undergraduate	whose	parent	is	unable	to	obtain	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	has	access	to	the	same	higher Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limits	as	an	independent	undergraduate	at	the	same	grade	level,	the	student	is	still considered	to	be	a	dependent	student	for	all	other	Title	IV	purposes.

For	more	detail	on	the	conditions	under	which	a	dependent	undergraduate	can	receive	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan	amounts,	see	&lt;Criteria	for	Dependent	Students	to	Receive	Additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Funds=	below.

## Criteria	for	Dependent	Students	to	Receive	Additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Funds

Dependent	students	whose	parents	are	unable	to	borrow	Direct	PLUS	Loans	due	to	adverse	credit	or	other	exceptional circumstances	may	receive	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	up	to	the	same	amount	that	is	available	to independent	undergraduate	students.	Because	Direct	PLUS	Loans	can	be	made	for	up	to	the	full	COA	minus	other	financial assistance	received,	the	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	may	not	be	sufficient	to	substitute	entirely	for	the amount	a	parent	could	receive	under	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	program.	Therefore,	you	should	determine	whether	the parents	may	be	able	to	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	by	obtaining	an	endorser	who	does	not	have	an	adverse	credit	history before	originating	additional	unsubsidized	loan	amounts	for	the	dependent	student.	Before	a	dependent	student	can receive	the	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount,	you	must	document	the	basis	of	the	student9s	eligibility.	Some basic	guidelines	for	making	this	determination	are	discussed	below.	However,	keep	in	mind	that	none	of	the	following,	by themselves,	are	sufficient	to	make	a	dependent	student	eligible	for	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds:

- The	parent9s	unwillingness	to	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	(even	though	the	parent	would	otherwise	be	eligible	to borrow);
- The	school9s	decision	not	to	participate	in	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	program;	or
- The	financial	aid	administrator9s	belief	that	the	parent	should	not	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

General	Guidelines	for	Determining	That	a	Dependent	Student	May	Receive	Additional	Unsubsidized	Funds

The	sections	that	follow	provide	general	guidelines	for	making	a	determination	that	a	dependent	student	is	eligible	to receive	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	under	various	circumstances.

## Only	One	Parent	Has	Applied	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	and	Been	Denied

If	only	one	of	a	student9s	parents	has	applied	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	and	been	denied	based	on	adverse	credit,	you	may award	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	on	that	basis,	without	first	determining	whether	there	is	another	parent who	could	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	However,	if	both	parents	apply	independently	and	one	is	approved	and	the	other denied,	the	dependent	student	is	not	eligible	for	the	additional	unsubsidized	loan	amounts.

## A	Previously	Approved	Parent	Later	Requests	Additional	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Funds	and	Is	Denied

The	dependent	student	may	become	eligible	at	any	time	during	an	academic	year	if	a	parent	has	first	been	approved	and then	later	denied	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	For	example,	if	a	parent	was	approved	for	and	received	the	full	amount	of	a	Direct PLUS	Loan	for	a	fall-spring	loan	period,	but	the	parent	is	subsequently	determined	ineligible	due	to	having	an	adverse credit	history	when	they	request	additional	Direct	PLUS	Loan	funds	later	during	the	spring	semester,	you	may	award additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	to	the	student.	However,	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	funds	that	the	parent	previously received	during	the	same	period	of	enrollment	must	be	treated	as	OFA	when	determining	the	additional	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	that	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive.

A	Parent	Is	Unable	To	Borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	For	Reasons	Other	Than	Adverse	Credit	History	(Exceptional Circumstances)

In	addition	to	cases	in	which	a	parent	has	been	denied	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	due	to	adverse	credit,	a	dependent undergraduate	student	may	also	be	eligible	for	increased	unsubsidized	loan	amounts	if	you	determine	and	document	the existence	of	exceptional	circumstances	other	than	adverse	credit	that	would	prevent	a	parent	from	borrowing	a	Direct PLUS	Loan.

If	you	make	such	a	determination,	you	may	award	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts	to	a	dependent undergraduate	even	if	the	student9s	parent	previously	applied	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	and	was	found	to	not	have	an adverse	credit	history.	Similarly,	if	you	make	such	a	determination	before	a	parent	has	requested	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	you may	award	the	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	to	the	dependent	student	without	requiring	the	parent	to	apply for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.

Examples	of	such	exceptional	circumstances	include,	but	are	not	limited,	to	the	following:

- The	parent	is	incarcerated.
- The	parent9s	whereabouts	are	unknown.
- The	parent	has	filed	for	bankruptcy	and	has	provided	a	letter	from	the	bankruptcy	court	stating	that	as	a	condition	of the	bankruptcy	filing,	the	parent	may	not	incur	any	additional	debt.
- The	parent9s	income	is	limited	to	public	assistance	or	disability	benefits,	and	you	have	documented	that	the	parent would	not	be	able	to	repay	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan.
- You	have	examined	the	family	financial	information	and	documented	the	parent9s	likely	inability	to	repay	the	Direct PLUS	Loan	due	to	an	existing	debt	burden	or	the	parent9s	expected	income-to-debt	ratio.
- The	parent	of	a	dependent	student	is	not	a	U.S.	citizen	or	permanent	resident,	is	not	a	qualified	alien,	or	is	not	able to	provide	evidence	from	the	Department	of	Homeland	Security	(DHS)	that	they	are	in	the	United	States	for	other than	a	temporary	purpose	with	the	intention	of	becoming	a	citizen	or	permanent	resident.

Before	originating	a	loan	for	the	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts	based	on	a	parent9s	ineligibility	for	a	Direct PLUS	Loan	due	to	adverse	credit	or	other	exceptional	circumstances,	you	must	document	the	basis	of	the	dependent student9s	eligibility.

A	determination	that	a	parent	is	ineligible	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	in	one	academic	year	based	on	adverse	credit	or	other exceptional	circumstances	does	not	automatically	support	the	dependent	student9s	additional	unsubsidized	loan	eligibility in	subsequent	years.	If	a	dependent	student	is	determined	to	be	eligible	for	additional	unsubsidized	loan	amounts	in	one academic	year,	you	must	re-examine	and	document	that	the	basis	for	the	student9s	eligibility	continues	to	exist	before originating	additional	unsubsidized	loan	amounts	for	the	student	in	a	subsequent	year.

## Annual	Loan	Limit	for	Graduate	and	Professional	Students

The	annual	loan	limit	for	graduate	or	professional	students	is	shown	below	in	Table	1C.	Graduate	and	professional students	are	not	eligible	to	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans,	so	the	annual	loan	limit	for	these	students	represents	only Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.

A	student	in	an	undergraduate	program	is	not	eligible	for	the	graduate	loan	limit	based	on	taking	graduate	coursework	as a	part	of	the	undergraduate	program.	In	contrast,	a	graduate	student	taking	some	undergraduate	coursework	is	eligible for	the	graduate	loan	limit	if	the	student	is	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	courses	(graduate	or	undergraduate)	that	can	be applied	to	the	graduate	program.	However,	the	student	must	already	be	admitted	into	the	graduate	program.

A	student	with	a	bachelor9s	degree	who	is	taking	preparatory	work	for	graduate	school	(or	whose	full	admission	to	the graduate	program	is	contingent	upon	completion	of	certain	undergraduate	courses)	is	not	eligible	for	graduate	loan	limits. See	the	discussion	later	in	this	chapter	on	annual	loan	limits	for	students	taking	preparatory	coursework.

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Table	1C:	Graduate	and	Professional	Student	Annual	Limits	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans

| Graduate and Professional Students   | Total (Unsubsidized Only)   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| All years                            | $20,500                     |

## Loan	Limit	Level	for	Transfer	Students

If	you9re	awarding	a	Direct	Loan	to	a	student	who	is	transferring	from	a	program	at	another	school	to	a	program	at	your school	that	is	greater	than	one	academic	year	in	length,	you	may	use	the	loan	limits	for	a	second-year	or	higher undergraduate	if	your	school	classifies	the	student	at	that	level	based	on	the	number	of	academic	credits	it	accepts	from the	prior	school,	or	based	on	the	granting	of	advance	standing	in	the	new	program	(but	see	below	for	guidance	on	when schools	are required to	use	the	third-year	and	beyond	undergraduate	annual	loan	limits	for	a	transfer	student).

Loan	Limit	When	a	Baccalaureate	or	Associate	Degree	Is	Required	for	Admission	to	an	Undergraduate	Program

For	a	student	who	has	an	associate	or	baccalaureate	degree	that	is	required	for	admission	into	an	undergraduate program,	you must use	the	third-year	and	beyond	undergraduate	loan	limits	for	that	student.

## Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans

There	are	no	fixed	annual	loan	limits	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans.	A	graduate	or	professional	student	may	be	awarded	a	Direct PLUS	Loan	for	up	to	the	student9s	COA	minus	OFA	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	3	for	packaging	rules).	Therefore,	a	graduate	or professional	student	who	has	received	the	maximum	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	for	an	academic	year	may	have additional	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility.	Similarly,	the	total	Direct	PLUS	Loan	amount	borrowed	by	a	parent	on	behalf	of	a dependent	student	may	not	exceed	the	student9s	estimated	COA	minus	OFA	the	student	receives	for	the	period	of enrollment.	This	is	the	only	borrowing	limit	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans.

Annual	Loan	Limit	for	Programs	Greater	Than	One	Academic	Year,	But	Less	Than	Two	Academic	Years	in	Length

The	&lt;Eligibility	and	Certification	Approval	Report=	(ECAR)	lists	&lt;one-year=	as	the	highest	educational	program	offered	by	a school	if	its	longest	program	is	one	academic	year	or	more	in	length,	but	less	than	two	academic	years.	Students	who have	successfully	completed	the	first	academic	year	of	such	programs	can	be	treated	as	second-year	undergraduates	for annual	loan	limit	purposes,	even	though	the	ECAR	lists	the	school9s	highest	program	offering	as	&lt;one-year.=	For	instance, a	student	enrolled	in	a	1,500	clock-hour	program	would	be	eligible	for	the	second-year	loan	limits	after	completing	the first	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	However,	because	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program	would	be less	than	a	full	academic	year	in	length,	the	loan	limit	would	have	to	be	prorated,	as	explained	in	Chapter	5	of	this volume.

## Annual	Loan	Limits	for	One-Year	and	Two-Year	Programs

If	a	program	can	normally	be	completed	in	one	year	of	full-time	study,	a	student	in	that	program	can	never	receive	more than	the	first-year	annual	loan	limit,	even	if	it	takes	the	student	more	than	one	academic	year	to	finish	the	program.

Similarly,	a	student	in	a	program	that	students	are	expected	to	complete	in	two	years	can	never	receive	more	than	the second-year	annual	loan	limit	for	an	academic	year,	even	if	individual	students	sometimes	take	more	than	two	years	to finish	the	program.	However,	some	schools	offer	associate	degree	programs	that	have	been	approved	by	the	school9s state	licensing	agency	or	accrediting	agency	as	programs	that	require	more	than	two	academic	years	of	study	for	a	fulltime	student	to	complete.	Students	enrolled	in	such	a	program	may	receive	Direct	Loans	at	the	third-year	annual	loan limit	after	they	have	successfully	completed	the	first	two	academic	years	of	the	program	and	if	the	school	has	a	grade level	progression	standard	that	allows	for	third	year	level	loans.

Note	also	that	a	school	may	not	link	two	stand-alone	one-year	programs	by	making	one	a	prerequisite	for	admission	and then	classify	students	beginning	the	second	one-year	program	as	second-year	undergraduates	for	loan	limit	purposes. However,	hours	or	credits	earned	in	a	prior	certificate	program	could	be	used	to	classify	a	transfer	student	at	a	grade level	higher	than	grade	level	one	if	the	student	transfers	into	a	program	that	is	greater	than	one	academic	year	in	length and	the	new	school	accepts	a	year9s	worth	of	credits	or	hours	from	the	prior	program.	For	instance,	if	a	school	admits	a transfer	student	from	a	certificate	program	and	accepts	900	clock	hours	that	the	student	earned	toward	its	1,500-hour program,	the	student	could	be	eligible	for	the	second-year	loan	limits	if	other	students	in	the	program	are	eligible	for second-year	loan	limits	after	completing	the	first	900	hours	of	the	program.

Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Preparatory	Coursework	and	Teacher	Certification	Programs

In	Chapter	1	of	this	volume	we	discussed	instances	in	which	a	student	may	receive	Direct	Loans	for	coursework	that	is	not part	of	an	eligible	program	leading	to	a	degree	or	certificate	awarded	by	the	school	(preparatory	coursework	and	teacher certification	programs).	The	annual	loan	limits	for	students	enrolled	in	preparatory	coursework	or	teacher	certification programs	are	shown	in	Tables	2A	and	2B	below.

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Table	2A:	Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Preparatory	Coursework	(Maximum	12	Consecutive	Months)

Preparatory	coursework	required	for	enrollment	in	an undergraduate program:

|                                                                                                     | Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)   | Maximum Subsidized   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Dependent undergraduates (excluding dependent students whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans)   | $ 2,625                               | $ 2,625              |
| Independent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans) | $ 8,625                               | $ 2,625              |

Preparatory	coursework	required	for	enrollment	in	a graduate	or	professional program:

|                                                                                                     | Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)   | Maximum Subsidized   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Dependent undergraduates (excluding dependent students whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans)   | $ 5,500                               | $ 5,500              |
| Independent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans) | $12,500                               | $ 5,500              |

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Table	2B:	Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Teacher	Certification	Coursework

|                                                                                                     | Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)   | Maximum Subsidized   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Dependent undergraduates (excluding dependent students whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans)   | $ 5,500                               | $ 5,500              |
| Independent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans) | $12,500                               | $ 5,500              |

Note	that	for	dependent	undergraduates,	the	annual	loan	limits	shown	above	in	Tables	2A	and	2B	do	not	provide	an additional	unsubsidized	loan	amount	beyond	the	maximum	annual	subsidized	amount,	as	is	the	case	with	the	loan	limits for	independent	undergraduates	and	dependent	undergraduates	whose	parents	cannot	get	Direct	PLUS	Loans.	For dependent	undergraduates	enrolled	in	preparatory	coursework	or	teacher	certification	programs,	there	is	just	a	single annual	loan	limit	representing	the	maximum	amount	of	subsidized	and/or	unsubsidized	loans	that	the	student	may receive	for	an	academic	year.

For	example,	a	dependent	undergraduate	taking	preparatory	coursework	required	for	enrollment	in	a	graduate	or professional	program	could	receive	up	to	$5,500	per	academic	year	in	Direct	Loan	funds,	which	could	be	all	subsidized,	all unsubsidized,	or	a	combination	of	subsidized	and	unsubsidized.	In	contrast,	an	independent	undergraduate	taking	the same	preparatory	coursework	could	receive	up	to	$12,500	per	academic	year,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	could	be subsidized.

Loan	limits	for	preparatory	coursework	and	teacher	certification	coursework	are	not	subject	to	proration	(see	Chapter	5	of this	volume)	if	the	coursework	is	less	than	a	full	academic	year.

## Combined	Undergraduate	and	Graduate	Programs

Some	programs	combine	undergraduate	and	graduate	study	and	allow	a	student	to	complete	both	a	bachelor's	degree and	a	graduate	or	professional	degree	within	the	same	program.	These	are	referred	to	as	"dual	degree	programs."	For instance,	a	school	could	offer	a	5-year	dual	degree	program	leading	to	both	a	bachelor's	degree	and	a	graduate	or professional	degree	and	could	define	the	first	three	or	four	years	of	study	as	being	at	the	undergraduate	level,	and	the remaining	year(s)	of	study	as	being	at	the	graduate	or	professional	level.	A	student	may	receive	Direct	Loans	at	the applicable	undergraduate	annual	loan	limits	(as	well	as	other	Title	IV	aid	at	the	undergraduate	level)	during	the undergraduate	portion	of	such	a	program,	and	then	may	receive	Direct	Loans	at	the	graduate	and	professional	student annual	loan	limit	(and	also	Direct	PLUS	Loans)	for	the	graduate	and	professional	portion	of	the	program.

See	Volume	1	for	more	detailed	guidance	on	student	eligibility	for	Title	IV	aid	in	programs	that	combine	undergraduate and	graduate	study,	including	programs	that	lead only to	a	graduate	or	professional	degree,	but	admit	students	who	do not	yet	meet	the	regulatory	requirements	to	be	considered	graduate	or	professional	degree	students.

## Students	Returning	for	a	Second	Baccalaureate	Degree

If	a	student	with	a	baccalaureate	degree	enrolls	in	another	baccalaureate	program,	the	student9s	grade	level	for	loan	limit purposes	would	be	based	on	the	amount	of	work	that	the	school	counts	toward	satisfying	the	requirements	of	the	new program.	For	instance,	if	your	school	accepts	30	semester	hours	of	a	student9s	work	in	a	previous	baccalaureate	program toward	the	requirements	for	a	BS	in	Chemistry	at	your	school	and,	on	that	basis,	classifies	the	student	at	the	second-year level,	then	the	student	would	be	eligible	for	second-year	undergraduate	loan	limits	(see	&lt;Loan	Limit	When	a Baccalaureate	or	Associate	Degree	Is	Required	for	Admission	to	an	Undergraduate	Program=	earlier	in	this	chapter	for	the loan	limit	that	applies	when	a	student	is required to	have	a	prior	associate	or	baccalaureate	degree	as	a	condition	for being	admitted	to	an	undergraduate	program).

Students	Who	Transfer	From	a	Graduate	Program	to	an	Undergraduate	Program	During	an	Academic	Year

If	a	student	transfers	from	a	graduate	program	to	an	undergraduate	program	in	the	middle	of	an	academic	year,	the undergraduate	annual	loan	limit	for	the	student9s	grade	level	applies	but	amounts	previously	borrowed	at	the	graduate level	within	the	same	academic	year	do	not	count	against	the	undergraduate	annual	loan	limit.	However,	the	total	amount awarded	for	the	academic	year	may	not	exceed	the	higher	(graduate	or	professional)	annual	loan	limit.

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Example	1:	Transfer	From	a	Graduate	to	Undergraduate	Program	During	the	Same	Academic Year

A	student	who	received	$10,250	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	for	a	fall	semester	loan	as	a	graduate	student enrolls	in	an	undergraduate	program	at	the	same	school	in	the	spring	semester	of	the	school9s	fall-spring academic	year	and	is	classified	as	a	third-year	independent	undergraduate.	As	a	third-year	independent undergraduate,	the	student9s	annual	loan	limit	is	$12,500,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized.

However,	the	student	may	not	receive	the	full	$12,500,	since	that	amount,	when	added	to	the	$10,250	the student	received	as	a	graduate	student	in	the	fall,	would	exceed	the	$20,500	graduate	or	professional	student annual	loan	limit.	Therefore,	the	student9s	maximum	loan	eligibility	for	the	spring	semester	(if	supported	by	COA and	OFA)	is	$10,250,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized.

Increased	Unsubsidized	Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Certain	Health	Professions	Students

There	are	higher	annual	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	limits	for	some	graduate	and	professional	health	professions	students. Schools	may	award	the	increased	unsubsidized	amounts	to	students	who	are	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	certain	health professions	programs.	The	programs	must	be	accredited	by	specific	accrediting	agencies.

The	programs	that	are	eligible	for	the	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts,	the	applicable	increased	unsubsidized loan	amounts,	and	the	approved	accrediting	agencies	for	these	programs	are	shown	in	Tables	3A	and	3B	below.	As	shown in	the	tables,	the	increased	unsubsidized	loan	annual	limits	vary	by	program	and	academic	year	length.

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Table	3A:	Health	Professions	Programs	Eligible	for	an	Additional	$20,000	or	$26,667

Additional	$20,000	in	Unsubsidized	Loans	for	an	Academic	Year	Covering	9	months

The	increased	unsubsidized	amounts	that	an	eligible	health	professions	student	may	receive	are	in	addition	to	the	regular $20,500	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	graduate	and	professional	students.	For	example,	a	student enrolled	in	a	nine-month	Doctor	of	Dentistry	program	is	eligible	for	the	regular	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	maximum for	a	graduate	or	professional	student	($20,500),	plus	the	maximum	increased	unsubsidized	amount	of	$20,000,	for	a total	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	maximum	of	$40,500	per	academic	year.

Graduate	and	professional	students	who	qualify	for	the	higher	annual	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	limits	are	also	eligible	for a	higher	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	aggregate	loan	limit,	as	explained	later	in	this	chapter.

Proration	of	the	Increased	Health	Professions	Annual	Loan	Limit	for	an	Academic	Year	Covering	10	or	11	Months

Tables	3A	and	3B	above	show	the	increased	unsubsidized	loan	limits	for	programs	with	an	academic	year	of	either	nine months	or	12	months.	For	eligible	health	professions	programs	with	an	academic	year	covering	10	or	11	months,	the annual	additional	unsubsidized	loan	limit	must	be	prorated.	If	the	academic	year	covers	10	or	11	months,	the	prorated annual	loan	limit	is	determined	by	dividing	the	applicable	loan	limit	for	an	academic	year	covering	nine	months	by	nine, and	then	multiplying	the	result	by	10	or	11.	For	example,	the	prorated	increased	unsubsidized	loan	limit	for	a	Doctor	of Dentistry	program	with	an	11-month	academic	year	would	be	$24,444,	calculated	as	follows:

$20,000	÷	9	=	$2,222.22

$2,222.22	x	11	=	$24,444.42,	rounded	to	$24,444

Foreign	Schools	May	Not	Award	Increased	Unsubsidized	Loan	Amounts

Foreign	schools	that	participate	in	the	Direct	Loan	Program	may	not	award	the	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan amounts	to	health	professions	students.

## Aggregate	Loan	Limit	Overview

As	explained	earlier	in	this	chapter,	there	are	limits	on	the	maximum	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan amounts	that	a	student	may	receive	each	academic	year	(annual	loan	limits).	There	are	also	limits	on	a	student9s maximum	outstanding	total	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	debt.	These	are	called	aggregate	loan limits.	A	borrower	who	has	reached	the	aggregate	borrowing	limit	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized Loans	may	not	receive	additional	loans.	Once	the	loans	are	repaid,	in	full	or	in	part,	the	borrower	may	apply	for	additional loans.

To	ensure	that	a	student	doesn9t	exceed	the	aggregate	loan	limits,	the	student9s	FAFSA	form	data	is	matched	with	NSLDS. If	the	student	has	exceeded	or	is	approaching	the	aggregate	loan	limits,	this	will	be	noted	in	the	ISIR.	If	a	student transfers	to	your	school,	you	must	inform	NSLDS	so	that	it	can	begin	the	Transfer	Student	Monitoring	process.

Aggregate	Loan	Limits	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans

The	aggregate	loan	limits	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	are	shown	in	Table	4	below.

## 34	CFR	685.203(d),	(e)

|                                                                                                     | Total (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)   | Maximum Subsidized   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Dependent undergraduates (excluding those whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans)                | $31,000                               | $23,000              |
| Independent undergraduates (and dependent undergraduates whose parents can9t get Direct PLUS Loans) | $57,500                               | $23,000              |
| Graduate and professional students                                                                  | $138,500                              | $65,500              |

Notes	on	the	aggregate	loan	limits	shown	in	Table	4:

- The	&lt;Total	(Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized)=	column	shows	the	maximum	combined	outstanding	subsidized	and unsubsidized	loan	debt	for	a	student.	The	&lt;Maximum	Subsidized=	column	shows	the	maximum	portion	of	the combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	limit	that	may	be	subsidized.	For	example,	a	dependent	undergraduate	may have	up	to	a	maximum	of	$31,000	in	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	outstanding	loan	debt,	but	no	more than	$23,000	of	this	amount	may	consist	of	subsidized	loans.
- Capitalized	interest	(unpaid	accrued	interest	that	has	been	added	to	the	principal	balance	of	a	loan)	is	not	counted toward	a	borrower9s	aggregate	loan	limits	(see	"Checking	Remaining	Loan	Eligibility	Under	Aggregate	Loan	Limits= below	for	more	information).
- The	$138,500	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	aggregate	loan	limit	for	graduate	and	professional	students includes	loans	received	for	undergraduate	study.
- The	$65,500	subsidized	aggregate	loan	limit	for	graduate	and	professional	students	includes	subsidized	loans received	for	prior	undergraduate	study.	It	also	includes	any	subsidized	loans	received	for	prior	graduate	or professional	study	before	July	1,	2012,	when	graduate	and	professional	students	were	eligible	to	receive	subsidized loans	(subsidized	loan	eligibility	for	graduate	and	professional	students	was	eliminated	effective	for	loan	periods beginning	on	or	after	July	1,	2012).
- The	loan	amounts	counted	toward	a	borrower9s	aggregate	loan	limits	include	any	outstanding	Direct	Subsidized	Loan and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts,	and	also	any	outstanding	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Federal	Stafford Loans	previously	borrowed	under	the	FFEL	Program	(no	new	loans	have	been	made	under	the	FFEL	Program	since June	30,	2010).
- If	a	borrower	has	a	Direct	Consolidation	Loan	or	a	Federal	Consolidation	Loan	(a	consolidation	loan	made	under	the FFEL	Program),	the	outstanding	amount	of	the	consolidation	loan	representing	any	Direct	Subsidized	Loans,	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans,	Subsidized	Federal	Stafford	Loans,	or	Unsubsidized	Federal	Stafford	Loans	that	were	paid	off	by the	consolidation	loan	is	counted	toward	the	borrower9s	aggregate	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loan	limits accordingly.

In	some	cases,	a	student	who	previously	received	undergraduate	and	graduate	degrees	returns	to	school	to	complete	a second	undergraduate	program.	Only	the	loans	that	the	student	received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program	are included	in	determining	the	student9s	remaining	eligibility	for	loans	for	the	second	undergraduate	program,	up	to	the undergraduate	aggregate	limits.	Although	loans	received	for	graduate	study	are	not	counted	toward	a	student9s undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit,	the	combined	loan	amounts	received	for	undergraduate	and	graduate	programs	may not	exceed	the	total	allowable	aggregate	loan	limits.

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Example	2:	Returning	to	an	Undergraduate	Program	After	Receiving	Loans	for	Graduate	Study

An	independent	student	has	received	the	following	loan	amounts	for	a	first	undergraduate	program	and	a graduate	program:

|               | Subsidized:   | Unsubsidized:   | Total    |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Undergraduate | $19,000       | $26,000         | $45,000  |
| Graduate      | $0            | $86,000         | $86,000  |
| Total         | $19,000       | $112,000        | $131,000 |

The	student	has	now	enrolled	in	a	second	undergraduate	program.	Only	the	loans	received	for	the	first undergraduate	program	are	counted	toward	the	student9s	undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit.	Because	the	total amount	received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program	($45,000)	does	not	exceed	the	aggregate	loan	limit	for	an independent	undergraduate	($57,500,	maximum	$23,000	subsidized),	the	student	has	remaining	loan	eligibility for	the	second	undergraduate	program.

The	difference	between	the	independent	undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit	and	the	total	amount	of	the	loans received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program	is	$12,000.	However,	the	student	may	not	receive	the	full	$12,000, because	that	amount,	when	combined	with	the	amount	received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program	and	the amount	received	for	the	graduate	program,	would	exceed	the	combined	undergraduate	and	graduate	aggregate loan	limit	of	$138,500:

$45,000	+	$86,000	+	$12,500	=	$143,500

Therefore,	the	student9s	remaining	loan	eligibility	for	the	second	undergraduate	program	is	$7,500	($138,500 minus	$131,000	already	received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program	and	the	graduate	program).	Not	more	than $4,000	of	this	amount	may	be	subsidized	($23,000	undergraduate	subsidized	aggregate	loan	limit	minus	$19,000 in	subsidized	loans	received	for	the	first	undergraduate	program).

Treatment	of	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	Received	for	Teacher	Certification	Coursework	or Preparatory	Coursework

Students	receiving	Direct	Loans	for	teacher	certification	coursework	or	for	preparatory	coursework	(including	preparatory coursework	required	for	admission	to	a	graduate	or	professional	program)	are	considered	to	be	undergraduates	for	all Title	IV	purposes.	Therefore,	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	that	a	student	receives	for	teacher certification	coursework	or	preparatory	coursework	are	counted	against	the	student's	undergraduate	aggregate	loan limits.	(See	Chapter	1	of	this	volume	and	the	discussion	earlier	in	this	chapter	for	guidance	on	Direct	Loan	eligibility	for teacher	certification	and	preparatory	coursework	and	the	applicable	annual	loan	limits.)

## Higher	Aggregate	Loan	Limit	for	Certain	Health	Professions	Students

As	explained	earlier	in	this	chapter,	graduate	and	professional	students	who	are	enrolled	in	certain	health	professions programs	are	eligible	for	higher	annual	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	limits.	These	students	also	have	a	higher	combined subsidized	and	unsubsidized	aggregate	loan	limit.

The	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	aggregate	loan	limit	for	graduate	and	professional	health	professions	students who	are	eligible	to	receive	the	increased	annual	unsubsidized	amounts	is	$224,000.	Not	more	than	$65,500	of	this amount	may	be	from	subsidized	loans	(see	the	notes	following	Table	4	above	regarding	the	$65,500	subsidized	aggregate loan	limit	for	graduate	and	professional	students).

If	a	student	who	received	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts	for	a	qualifying	health	profession	program	later enrolls	in	a	non-health	professions	program,	the	student	is	no	longer	eligible	for	the	increased	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan limits.	However,	the	additional	loan	amounts	received	for	the	health	professions	program	are	not	counted	toward	the normal	aggregate	loan	limit	for	that	student.

## Checking	Remaining	Eligibility	Under	the	Aggregate	Loan	Limits

Before	originating	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	or	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan,	it9s	important	to	make	sure	the	student	still	has remaining	eligibility	under	the	aggregate	loan	limits.	As	long	as	there	is	no	conflicting	information,	you	may	rely	on	the financial	aid	history	(provided	on	the	ISIR	as	well	as	on	the	NSLDS	Professional	Access	website)	and	the	Transfer	Student Monitoring	process	(for	transfer	students	only)	to	tell	you	if	a	student	is	about	to	exceed	the	applicable	aggregate	loan limit.	(See	Volume	1,	Chapter	3	for	more	detail	on	NSLDS	financial	aid	history,	which	may	also	affect	eligibility	for	other Title	IV	programs.)

The	Loan	History	in	NSLDS	for	a	borrower	who	has	received	Title	IV	loans	shows	Aggregate	Loan	Information	for	the borrower9s	outstanding	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loans.	The	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Aggregate	Outstanding Principal	Balance	amounts	shown	for	a	borrower	in	NSLDS	do	not	include	unpaid	accrued	interest,	capitalized	interest (unpaid	interest	that	has	been	added	to	the	principal	balance	of	the	loan),	or	other	charges,	as	these	amounts	are	not counted	against	the	aggregate	loan	limits.

For	each	individual	loan	that	a	borrower	has	received,	NSLDS	shows	both	the	Outstanding	Principal	Balance	(OPB)	and	the Aggregate	Outstanding	Principal	Balance	(Agg.	OPB).	The	OPB	is	what	the	borrower	owes,	which	may	include	capitalized interest	and	other	charges.	The	Agg.	OPB	is	the	portion	of	the	OPB	that	counts	against	the	aggregate	loan	limits	for subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loans.

For	instance,	suppose	a	student	has	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	disbursed	in	the	amount	of	$5,000.	Over	time,	$200	in interest	accrues	and	is	capitalized.	Assuming	that	the	borrower	has	made	no	payments	on	the	loan,	the	OPB	on	the	loan will	be	$5,200	(this	is	the	amount	the	borrower	owes),	and	the	Agg.	OPB	will	be	$5,000	(this	is	the	amount	that	is	counted against	the	aggregate	loan	limit).	If	you	are	looking	at	information	in	NSLDS	for	individual	loans,	it	is	the	Agg.	OPB	that you	should	use	to	determine	the	student9s	remaining	loan	eligibility	under	the	applicable	aggregate	loan	limit.

The	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Aggregate	Outstanding	Principal	Balance	amounts	displayed	in	NSLDS	for	a	borrower also	include	the	outstanding	portion	of	consolidation	loans	(both	Direct	Consolidation	Loans	and	Federal	Consolidation Loans	made	under	the	FFEL	program)	attributable	to	Direct	Subsidized	Loans,	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	Subsidized Federal	Stafford	Loans,	and	Unsubsidized	Federal	Stafford	Loans	that	were	repaid	by	the	consolidation	loan.

## Unallocated	Consolidation	Loan	Amounts

NSLDS	may	also	show	a	&lt;Consolidation	Loans,	Unallocated=	amount	that	is	not	counted	against	a	borrower9s	aggregate loan	limits.	The	&lt;Consolidation	Loans,	Unallocated=	amount	represents	the	portion	of	a	consolidation	loan	that	cannot	be attributed	to	other	loans	in	the	borrower9s	loan	history.	For	example,	it	may	represent	capitalized	interest	or	non-Title	IV loans	that	were	consolidated.	You	are	not	responsible	for	determining	the	origin	of	any	unallocated	consolidation	loan amounts.

Treatment	of	Consolidated	Perkins	Loans	and	PLUS	Loans

A	consolidated	Perkins	Loan	or	PLUS	loan	becomes	part	of	the	unsubsidized	portion	of	a	consolidation	loan,	but	it	is	not counted	toward	the	borrower9s	aggregate	Direct	Loan	limits.

Effect	of	a	Change	in	Student	Status	on	Aggregate	Loan	Limits

In	some	cases,	a	student	may	qualify	for	higher	loan	limits	but	then	lose	eligibility	for	the	higher	limits	due	to	a	change	in status.	One	such	situation	is	when	a	dependent	undergraduate	qualifies	for	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amounts because	the	student9s	parent	is	unable	to	obtain	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	but	in	a	subsequent	academic	year	the	student9s parent	qualifies	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.	In	this	circumstance	the	dependent	student	no	longer	qualifies	for	the	additional unsubsidized	loan	amounts	at	the	higher	independent	undergraduate	annual	and	aggregate	loan	limits.	During	any academic	year	when	a	dependent	student9s	parent	qualifies	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	the	student	is	subject	to	the dependent	undergraduate	annual	and	aggregate	loan	limits,	but	only	loan	amounts	the	student	otherwise	would	have been	eligible	to	receive	under	the	dependent	undergraduate	annual	loan	limits	are	counted	when	determining	the student9s	remaining	eligibility	under	the	$31,000	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	dependent	undergraduate aggregate	limit	(see	Example	3	below).

A	similar	situation	occurs	when	a	student	who	received	loans	for	a	graduate	or	professional	degree	program	later	returns to	school	and	enrolls	in	an	undergraduate	program.	The	student	is	then	subject	to	the	undergraduate	annual	and aggregate	loan	limits,	but	only	loan	amounts	the	student	previously	received	as	an	undergraduate	are	counted	when determining	the	student9s	remaining	eligibility	under	the	undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit	(see	Example	2	earlier	in	this chapter).

Volume	8,	Chapter	4,	Example	3:	Aggregate	Loan	Limits	and	Additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	Amounts	When Parents	Are	Unable	To	Obtain	Direct	PLUS	Loans

A	dependent	student	receives	additional	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	(up	to	the	additional	amounts	available to	independent	undergraduates)	for	the	first	three	years	of	a	four-year	program	because	the	student9s	parent	is unable	to	obtain	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	for	each	of	those	years.

For	each	of	the	first	three	years,	the	student	receives	the	maximum	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loan	amounts under	the	independent	student	annual	loan	limits	(remember	that	the	annual	subsidized	maximums	are	the	same for	dependent	and	independent	undergraduates):

| First Year (independent student loan limit)   | $3,500 subsidized   | $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum)   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Second Year (independent student loan limit)  | $4,500 subsidized   | $6,000 unsubsidized ($4,000 more than dependent maximum)   |
| Third Year (independent student loan limit)   | $5,500 subsidized   | $7,000 unsubsidized ($5,000 more than dependent maximum)   |
| Total                                         | $13,500 subsidized  | $19,000 unsubsidized ($13,000 more than dependent maximum) |

In	the	fourth	year,	the	parent	is	eligible	to	borrow	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan,	so	the	student	is	then	subject	to	the	annual and	aggregate	loan	limits	for	a	dependent	undergraduate.	The	dependent	student	received	a	total	of	$13,500	in Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	and	$19,000	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	($32,500	combined	subsidized	and unsubsidized	total)	for	the	first	three	years	when	the	student9s	parent	was	unable	to	obtain	Direct	PLUS	Loans. These	are	the	same	amounts	that	an	independent	student	who	qualified	for	the	maximum	annual	loan	limit	each year	could	have	received.	If	the	student9s	parent	had	been	able	to	receive	Direct	PLUS	Loans	during	each	of	the first	three	years	and	the	student	received	the	maximum	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loan	amounts	under	the

dependent	student	annual	loan	limits,	the	total	loan	amounts	received	would	have	been	$13,500	in	Direct Subsidized	Loan	funds	and	$6,000	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	($19,500	combined	subsidized	and unsubsidized	total).

Because	the	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loan	amount	of	$32,500	that	the	student	received	for	years one	through	three	exceeds	the	$31,000	dependent	undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit,	it	might	appear	that	the student	would	have	no	remaining	loan	eligibility	for	the	fourth	year	of	the	program.	However,	only	the	$19,500	in combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	loan	funds	that	the	student	could	have	received	under	the	dependent student	annual	loan	limits	are	counted	against	the	$31,000	aggregate,	leaving	the	student	with	$11,500	in remaining	loan	eligibility	under	the	dependent	undergraduate	aggregate	loan	limit,	not	more	than	$9,500	of which	may	be	subsidized.	Therefore,	in	the	fourth	year	of	the	program	(when	the	student9s	parent	is	eligible	to receive	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan),	the	student	could	receive	up	to	the	full	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized annual	loan	limit	for	a	dependent	fourth-year	undergraduate	(that	is,	$7,500,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	may be	subsidized).

## Chapter	5 Loan	Limit	Proration

## Proration	Overview

The	annual	maximum	loan	amount	an	undergraduate	student	may	receive	must	be	prorated	(reduced)	when	the	borrower is:

- Enrolled	in	a	program	that	is	shorter	than	a	full	academic	year;	or
- Enrolled	in	a	program	that	is	one	academic	year	or	more	in	length	but	is	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	(a	period	of study	at	the	end	of	which	a	student	will	have	completed	all	requirements	of	the	program)	that	is	shorter	than	a	full academic	year.

With	one	exception	(see	"Proration	of	the	Annual	Loan	Limit	for	Students	who	Graduate	Early	From	Clock-Hour	Programs" later	in	this	chapter),	the	annual	loan	limits	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	are	prorated	only in	these	two	situations.	Loan	limits	are	not	prorated	based	on	a	student9s	enrollment	status,	such	as	when	a	student	is enrolled	less	than	full	time,	or	when	a	student	is	enrolled	for	a	period	of	less	than	a	full	academic	year	that	is	not	a remaining	period	of	study.

The	annual	loan	limit	for	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	is	not	prorated	for	students	enrolled	in	graduate	or	professional	level programs.	Loan	proration	requirements	also	do	not	apply	to	students	taking	preparatory	coursework	or	coursework necessary	for	teacher	certification.	This	is	because	the	annual	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	only	when	a	student	is	enrolled in	a	program	or	remaining	portion	of	a	program	that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year.	Students	taking	preparatory coursework	or	teacher	certification	coursework	are	not	considered	to	be	enrolled	in	a	program	for	purposes	of	awarding Title	IV	aid.

It9s	important	to	understand	that	loan	limit	proration	determines	the maximum	loan	amount that	a	student	may	borrow for	a	program	or	remaining	balance	of	a	program,	not	the	actual	loan	amount	a	student	is	eligible	to	receive.	In	some cases,	the	loan	amount	a	student	is	eligible	to	receive	(based	on	costs,	SAI,	and	OFA)	may	be	less	than	the	prorated	loan limit.

Loan	Limit	Proration

## 34	CFR	685.203(a),	(b),	(c)

Use	of	Fractions	vs.	Decimals	When	Prorating	Loan	Limits

As	we	explain	in	more	detail	below,	proration	involves	multiplying	the	annual	loan	limit	by	a	fraction.	You	may	choose	to convert	the	fraction	to	a	decimal	and	then	multiply	the	annual	loan	limit	by	the	decimal,	but	this	conversion	is	not	a requirement.	However,	you	should	be	consistent	in	the	method	you	use,	since	the	fraction	and	decimal	calculations sometimes	result	in	slightly	different	prorated	loan	limits,	as	shown	in	the	examples	later	in	the	chapter.

Using	the	School9s	Academic	Year	Definition	If	Longer	Than	the	Title	IV	Minimum

As	explained	above,	proration	of	the	annual	loan	limit	is	required	when	an	undergraduate	student	is	enrolled	in	a	program that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year	or	is	enrolled	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year. A	school	may	choose	to	define	its	academic	year	as	longer	in	weeks	or	hours	than	the	minimum	statutory	requirements.	If so,	the	school9s	standard	3	not	the	statutory	minimum	3	determines	whether	a	program	or	a	final	period	of	study	is	shorter than	an	academic	year.

Separate	Calculations	for	the	Combined	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Annual	Loan	Limit	and	the	Maximum	Subsidized

Annual	Loan	Limit

As	explained	in	Chapter	4	of	this	volume,	for	undergraduate	students	there	is	a	maximum	combined	annual	loan	limit	for Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	and	a	maximum	portion	of	that	combined	annual	loan	limit	that	a student	may	receive	in	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.	If	the	annual	loan	limit	for	an	undergraduate	student	must	be	prorated, you	must	first	determine	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	prorated	annual	loan	limit, and	then	separately	determine	the	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	prorated	annual	loan	limit.	This	is	illustrated	in	the	proration examples	below.

Prorating	Loan	Limits	for	Programs	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

If	an	academic	program	is	shorter	than	a	full	academic	year	in	length,	you	must	multiply	the	applicable	loan	limit(s)	by	the lesser of	4

or

The	result	is	the	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	that	program.

Proration	Examples:	Programs	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

Examples	1	and	2	illustrate	how	the	prorated	annual	loan	limit	is	determined	when	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	program	that is	shorter	than	an	academic	year.

Semester,	trimester,	quarter,	or	clock	hours	enrolled	in	program

Semester,	trimester,	quarter,	or	clock	hours	in	academic	year

Weeks	enrolled	in	program

Weeks	in	the	academic	year

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	1:	Clock-Hour	Program	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

A	dependent	student	is	enrolled	in	a	400	clock-hour,	12-week	program	(a	&lt;short-term	program=	as	described	in Volume	2,	Chapter	2).	The	school	defines	the	academic	year	for	this	program	as	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of instructional	time.

To	determine	the	maximum	loan	amount	the	student	can	borrow,	convert	the	fractions	based	on	weeks	and	hours to	decimals:

- 12	weeks	in	program/26	weeks	in	academic	year	=	0.46

400	hours	in	program/900	hours	in	academic	year	=0.44

Multiply	the	smaller	decimal	(0.44)	by	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual loan	limit	for	a	first-year	dependent	undergraduate	($5,500,	not	more	than	$3,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized):

$5,500	x	0.44	=	$2,420	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$2,420	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$3,500	by	the	smaller	decimal (0.44):

$3,500	x	0.44	=	$1,540	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

The	maximum	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	the	student	can	borrow	for the	program	is	$2,420,	but	no	more	than	$1,540	of	this	amount	may	be	in	subsidized	loans.

Note: In	Example	1	above	and	in	the	other	proration	examples	that	follow,	the	fractions	are	converted	to decimals.	As	an	alternative	you	could	choose	to	multiply	the	annual	loan	limit	by	the	original	fraction,	though	you should	be	consistent	in	using	one	method	or	the	other.	Using	the	fraction	400/900	in	Example	1	instead	of	the decimal	0.44	would	result	in	a	slightly	higher	prorated	loan	limit:	$5,500	x	400/900	=	$2,444.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	2:	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Program	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

An	independent	student	is	enrolled	in	a	24	quarter-hour,	20-week	program.	The	school	defines	the	academic	year for	this	program	as	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.

To	determine	the	maximum	loan	amount	the	student	can	borrow,	convert	the	fractions	based	on	weeks	and quarter-hours	to	decimals:

20	weeks	in	program/30	weeks	in	academic	year=	0.67

24	hours	in	program/36	hours	in	academic	year=	0.67

Multiply	the	smaller	decimal	(in	this	case,	both	are	0.67)	by	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a	first-year	independent	undergraduate	($9,500,	not	more	than	$3,500	of which	may	be	subsidized):

$9,500	x	0.67	=	$6,365	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$6,365	prorated	annual	loan	limit	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$3,500	by	the	same	decimal	(0.67):

$3,500	x	0.67	=	$2,345	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

The	maximum	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	the	student	can	borrow	for the	program	is	$6,365,	not	more	than	$2,345	of	which	may	be	in	subsidized	loans.

Note: Using	the	fraction	24/36	in	Example	2	instead	of	the	decimal	0.67	would	result	in	a	slightly	lower	prorated loan	limit:	$9,500	x	24/36	=	$6,333.

Prorating	Loan	Limits	for	Remaining	Periods	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

You	must	also	prorate	loan	limits	for	students	enrolled	in	remaining	periods	of	study	shorter	than	an	academic	year.	This circumstance	can	occur	when	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	program	that	is	one	academic	year	or	more	in	length,	but	the remaining	period	of	study	needed	to	complete	the	program	(sometimes	called	a	&lt;final=	period	of	study)	will	be	shorter than	an	academic	year.

Proration	is	required	only	when	you	know	in	advance	that	a	student	will	be	enrolled	for	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is shorter	than	an	academic	year.	With	one	exception,	if	a	student	originally	enrolls	for	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is	a full	academic	year	in	length,	but	completes	the	program	in	less	than	a	full	academic	year,	there	is	no	requirement	to retroactively	prorate	the	annual	loan	limit	(for	the	exception,	see	&lt;Proration	of	the	Annual	Loan	Limit	for	Students	Who

Graduate	Early	From	a	Clock-Hour	Program=	later	in	this	chapter).

In	a standard-term	program,	or	a	credit-hour	program	using	SE9W	nonstandard	terms ,	a	remaining	period	of study	is	considered	shorter	than	an	academic	year	if	the	remaining	period	contains	fewer	terms	than	the	number	of	terms covered	by	the	school9s	Title	IV	academic	year.	For	programs	that	are	offered	in	a	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY;	see Chapter	6),	the	number	of	terms	covered	in	the	school9s	Title	IV	academic	year	usually	does	not	include	a	summer &lt;header=	or	&lt;trailer=	term.

Consider	a	student	who	is	enrolled	in	a	four-year	program	that	is	offered	in	an	SAY	consisting	of	three	quarters	plus	a summer	trailer,	and	who	has	completed	four	academic	years	of	study.	The	student	needs	to	attend	an	additional	quarter term	to	complete	the	program	requirements.	The	final	quarter	term	falls	in	a	new	academic	year;	therefore	the	annual loan	limit	must	be	prorated	because	the	remaining	period	of	study	(a	single	quarter)	is	less	than	a	full	academic	year.

Similarly,	if	a	student	enrolled	in	a	two-year	program	not	offered	in	an	SAY	(where	the	Title	IV	academic	year	covers	two 15-week	semesters)	has	completed	two	academic	years	of	study,	but	needs	to	return	for	an	additional	semester	to complete	the	program	requirements,	the	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	if	the	student	receives	a	loan	for	the	final	semester.

Note	that	for	standard-term	programs	or	credit-hour	programs	with	SE9W	nonstandard	terms,	the	length	of	the	loan period	does	not	determine	whether	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is	shorter	than	an	academic year.	The	determining	factor	is	the	length	of	the	remaining	period	of	study	in	which	the	student	is	enrolled,	which	may	not be	the	same	as	the	loan	period.	For	example,	if	an	undergraduate	student	is	enrolled	for	a	full	SAY	consisting	of	fall	and spring	semesters,	and	will	complete	the	program	at	the	end	of	the	spring	term,	but	is	enrolled	less	than	half	time	during the	spring,	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	only	for	the	fall	semester.	Although	the	loan	period	(fall	only)	is shorter	than	an	academic	year,	the	remaining	period	of	study	(fall	through	spring)	is	a	full	academic	year.	Therefore,	if	the student	receives	a	Direct	Loan	in	the	fall,	proration	of	the	annual	loan	limit	is	not	required.

In	a clock-hour	program,	non-term	program,	or	a	program	with	non-SE9W	nonstandard	terms ,	a	remaining period	of	study	is	considered	less	than	an	academic	year	if	it	consists	of	fewer	clock	or	credit	hours	than	the	program9s defined	Title	IV	academic	year.	In	contrast	to	standard	term	and	SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs,	if	a	student	enrolled in	a	clock-hour,	non-term,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	program	is	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	shorter	than	an academic	year	and	receives	a	Direct	Loan,	the	loan	period	and	the	remaining	period	of	study	will	always	be	the	same.	This is	because	for	these	programs	the	minimum	loan	period	is	the	lesser	of	the	length	of	the	program	(or	remaining	portion	of a	program)	or	the	academic	year.

For	all	types	of	programs,	you	determine	the	prorated	loan	limit	for	a	student	enrolled	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	less than	an	academic	year	by	multiplying	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	by	the	following	fraction:

Semester,	trimester,	quarter,	or	clock	hours	enrolled	in	program

Semester,	trimester,	quarter,	or	clock	hours	in	academic	year

Unlike	proration	for	programs	that	are	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	there	is	no	comparison	of	weeks	and	hours. Only the	credit	or	clock	hours	that	the	student	is	scheduled	to	attend,	or	is	actually	attending,	at	the	time	of origination	are	used	in	the	calculation.

Proration	Examples:	Remaining	Periods	of	Study	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

Examples	3	through	7	illustrate	how	the	prorated	annual	loan	limit	is	determined	when	a	student	is	enrolled	in	a remaining	period	of	study	shorter	than	an	academic	year.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	3:	Remaining	Period	=	One	Quarter

A	dependent	student	is	enrolled	in	a	two-year	credit-hour	program	offered	in	standard	terms	(quarters).	The school	defines	the	academic	year	for	the	program	as	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time (covering	three	quarters:	fall,	winter,	and	spring).

The	student	has	attended	the	program	for	six	quarters	(two	academic	years),	but	to	finish	the	program	needs	to complete	an	additional	six	hours	(half	time)	in	the	fall	quarter	of	the	next	academic	year:

Fall

(half	time:	6	hours)

Winter

(not	enrolled)

Spring

(not	enrolled)

To	determine	the	prorated	Direct	Loan	limit	for	the	student9s	remaining	period	of	study	(one	quarter),	convert	the fraction	based	on	the	hours	that	the	student	is	expected	to	attend	and	the	hours	in	the	academic	year	to	a decimal:

- 6	hours	in	fall/36	hours	in	academic	year	=	0.17

Multiply	this	decimal	by	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a dependent	second-year	undergraduate	($6,500,	not	more	than	$4,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized):

$6,500	x	0.17	=	$1,105	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$1,105	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$4,500	by	the	same	decimal	(0.17):

$4,500	x	0.17	=	$765	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

The	maximum	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	amount	the	student	can	borrow	for the	remaining	portion	of	the	program	is	$1,105,	not	more	than	$765	of	which	may	be	subsidized.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	4:	Remaining	Period	=	Two	Semesters,	With	Less	Than	Half-Time	Enrollment	in	One Term

The	student	from	Example	3	transfers	to	a	BA	program	at	a	different	school.	The	academic	year	for	the	program contains	two	semesters,	fall	and	spring.	During	the	second	year	of	the	BA	program,	the	student	will	be	enrolled full	time	in	the	fall	and	less	than	half	time	in	the	spring,	and	will	graduate	at	the	end	of	the	spring	term:

Fall

(full	time)

Spring

(less	than	half	time)

Although	the	student	is	not	eligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	for	the	spring	term,	the	remaining	period	of	study (two	semesters)	is	equal	to	a	full	academic	year.	Therefore,	proration	of	the	annual	loan	limit	is	not	required	if	the student	receives	a	Direct	Loan	for	the	fall	term.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	5:	Remaining	Period	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year,	With	Less	Than	Half-Time Enrollment	in	One	Term

A	dependent	fourth-year	undergraduate	is	enrolled	in	a	program	with	a	defined	academic	year	of	36	quarter hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time,	covering	three	quarters	(fall,	winter,	and	spring).	The	student	will	attend the	fall	and	winter	quarters,	but	not	the	spring	quarter,	and	will	graduate	at	the	end	of	the	winter	term.

The	student	will	be	enrolled	for	12	quarter	hours	(full	time)	during	the	fall	quarter,	but	will	be	enrolled	for	only three	hours	(less	than	half	time)	in	the	winter	quarter:

Fall

(full	time:	12	hours)

Winter

(less	than	half	time:	3	hours)

Spring

(not	enrolled)

The	student9s	final	period	of	study	(two	terms)	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	so	the	annual	loan	limit	must	be prorated.	However,	because	the	student	will	be	enrolled	less	than	half	time	during	the	winter	quarter	(and therefore	ineligible	to	receive	Direct	Loan	funds	for	that	term),	the	loan	period	will	cover	the	fall	quarter	only. Only	the	12	quarter	hours	will	be	used	for	the	fall	term	are	to	determine	the	prorated	annual	loan	limit.

To	determine	the	prorated	loan	limit	for	the	final	period	of	study,	convert	the	fraction	based	on	the	hours	that	the student	is	expected	to	attend	in	the	fall	quarter	and	the	hours	in	the	academic	year	to	a	decimal:

- 12	hours	enrolled	in	fall/36	hours	in	academic	year	=	0.33

Multiply	this	decimal	by	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a dependent	fourth-year	undergraduate	($7,500,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized):

$7,500	x	0.33	=	$2,475	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$2,475	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$5,500	by	the	same	decimal	(0.33):

$5,500	x	0.33	=	$1,815	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

The	total	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	the	fall	quarter	loan	is	$2,475,	not	more	than	$1,815	of	which	may	be subsidized.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	6:	Remaining	Period	=	Two	Quarters,	Separated	by	a	Period	of	Non-Enrollment

A	school	has	an	academic	year	that	covers	three	quarters:	fall,	winter,	and	spring.	An	independent	fourth-year undergraduate	will	be	enrolled	full	time	in	the	fall	and	spring	quarters,	but	will	not	attend	the	winter	quarter,	and will	graduate	at	the	end	of	the	spring	quarter:

Fall

(full	time:	12	hours)

Winter

(not	enrolled)

Spring

(full	time:	12	hours

Because	the	fall	quarter	is	in	the	same	academic	year	as	the	student9s	final	quarter	of	attendance,	it	is	part	of	the remaining	period	of	study,	even	though	there	is	a	term	between	the	fall	and	spring	quarters	in	which	the	student will	not	be	enrolled.	As	explained	under	&lt;Loan	Periods=	in	Chapter	2,	the	school	may	originate	a	single	loan	for	a loan	period	covering	the	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters	(but	no	costs	associated	with	the	winter	quarter	may	be included	when	determining	the	loan	amount	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive).

The	remaining	period	of	study	(two	terms)	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	so	the	annual	loan	limit	for	each	loan must	be	prorated	based	on	the	total	number	of	hours	for	which	the	student	is	enrolled	in	the	fall	and	spring quarters.

The	prorated	loan	limit	is	determined	by	converting	the	fraction	based	on	the	combined	number	of	hours	in	the fall	and	spring	terms	to	a	decimal:

24	hours	enrolled	in	fall	and	spring	/36	hours	in	academic	year	=	0.67

Note:	In	this	example	the	decimal	is	rounded	up:

24/36	=	0.666,	rounded	up	to	0.67

It	would	also	be	acceptable	to	truncate	the	decimal	to	0.66,	but	you	should	be	consistent	in	the	method	used, since	rounding	up	vs.	truncating	will	result	in	slightly	different	amounts	(see	below).

Multiply	this	decimal	by	the	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	for	an	independent	fourthyear	undergraduate	($12,500,	not	more	than	$5,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized):

$12,500	x	0.67	=	$8,375	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	the	fall	and	spring terms.

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$8,375	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds	for	the	fall	and	spring	terms,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$5,500 by	the	same	decimal	(0.67):

$5,500	x	0.67	=	$3,685	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	the	fall	and	spring	terms.

The	maximum	loan	amount	the	student	may	receive	for	the	two	terms	in	the	final	period	of	study	(fall	and	spring) combined	is	$8,375,	not	more	than	$3,685	of	which	may	be	subsidized.

As	an	alternative,	the	school	could	choose	to	originate	separate	fall-only	and	spring-only	loans.	With	this	option, the	prorated	loan	limit	is	determined	separately	for	each	term	by	converting	the	fraction	based	on	the	number	of hours	in	each	term	to	a	decimal:

12	hours	enrolled	in	term	/36	hours	in	academic	year	=	0.33

This	decimal	is	then	be	multiplied	by	the	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	for	an independent	fourth-year	undergraduate:

$12,500	x	0.33	=	$4,125	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	a	single	term	(fall or	spring)

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$4,125	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds	for	a	single	term,	the	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$5,500	is	multiplied	by	the	same decimal	(0.33):

$5,500	x	0.33	=	$1,815	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	a	single	term	(fall	or	spring)

The	prorated	loan	limit	for	each	single-term	loan	(fall-only	and	spring-only)	in	the	remaining	period	of	study	is $4,125,	not	more	than	$1,815	of	which	may	be	subsidized.	This	means	that	the	maximum	loan	amount	the student	may	receive	for	the	two	terms	in	the	final	period	of	study	combined	is	$8,250,	not	more	than	$3,630	of which	may	be	subsidized.

Note:	With	the	alternate	approach	of	originating	separate	fall-only	and	spring-only	loans,	the	total	loan	amount the	student	receives	is	slightly	less	than	the	total	amount	determined	using	the	single	loan	approach	with	a	fallwinter-spring	loan	period,	as	described	earlier	in	this	section.	This	is	due	to	rounding	up	the	fraction	to	0.67	in	the single	loan	approach.	If	the	fraction	used	in	the	single-loan	period	approach	were	instead	truncated	to	0.66,	both approaches	would	result	in	the	same	total	loan	amount.

A	school	has	an	1800	clock-hour	program	with	a	defined	academic	year	of	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of instructional	time.	A	dependent	undergraduate	student	successfully	completes	the	first	900	clock	hours	of	the program	in	22	weeks	of	instructional	time.	However,	the	student	must	complete	an	additional	four	weeks	of instructional	time	before	receiving	a	second	loan	(see	Chapter	6	of	this	volume).

After	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	have	elapsed,	the	student	has	successfully	completed	1,040	clock	hours	and may	then	receive	a	second	loan.	However,	the	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	based	on	the	number	of	clock	hours remaining	in	the	program	at	this	point	(760).	To	determine	the	prorated	loan	limit	for	the	student9s	second	loan, convert	the	fraction	based	on	the	number	of	clock	hours	remaining	to	a	decimal:

760	hours	remaining	in	program/900	hours	in	academic	year	=	0.84

Multiply	this	decimal	by	the	combined	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	a dependent	second-year	undergraduate	($6,500,	not	more	than	$4,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized):

$6,500	x	0.84	=	$5,460	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

To	determine	the	maximum	portion	of	the	$5,460	prorated	annual	loan	limit	that	the	student	may	receive	in subsidized	loan	funds,	multiply	the	maximum	subsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$4,500	by	the	same	decimal	(0.84):

$4,500	x	0.84	=	$3,780	subsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit

The	total	prorated	loan	limit	for	the	remaining	period	of	study	is	$5,460,	not	more	than	$3,780	of	which	may	be subsidized.

Proration	of	the	Annual	Loan	Limit	for	Students	Who	Graduate	Early	From	a	Clock-Hour	Program

Under	the	regulations	that	govern	the	treatment	of	Title	IV	funds	when	a	student	withdraws,	a	student	who	completes	all the	requirements	for	graduation	from	a	program	before	completing	the	days	or	hours	that	they	were	scheduled	to complete	is	not	considered	to	have	withdrawn,	and	no	return	of	Title	IV	funds	calculation	is	required	(see	Volume	5	for more	detail).	However,	a	school	may	be	required	to	return	a	portion	of	the	Direct	Loan	funds	that	were	disbursed	to	a student	who	successfully	completes	the	requirements	for	graduation	from	a	clock-hour	program	before	completing	the number	of	clock	hours	that	they	were	scheduled	to	complete.

A	student's	eligibility	to	receive	Title	IV	aid	for	a	clock-hour	program	is	based,	in	part,	on	the	total	number	of	clock	hours in	the	program.	If	a	school	allows	a	student	to	graduate	from	a	clock-hour	program	without	completing	all	the	originally established	hours	for	the	program,	the	school	has	effectively	shortened	the	program	length	and	reduced	a	student's	Title IV	aid	eligibility	for	the	program.	In	this	circumstance,	the	school	must	prorate	(or	re-prorate)	the	annual	loan	limit	for	the student	based	on	the	number	of	hours	the	student	actually	completed,	and	after	this	recalculation,	the	school	must	return to	the	Department	any	portion	of	the	Direct	Loan	funds	the	student	received	that	exceed	the	newly	prorated	(or	reprorated)	annual	loan	limit.	(For	a	student	who	received	a	Pell	Grant,	the	school	must	also	recalculate	the	student's	Pell Grant	award	in	this	situation.	See	Volume	7	for	more	information.)

This	requirement	applies only to	clock-hour	programs,	and	it	applies	regardless	of	the	length	of	the	program	or	remaining portion	of	a	program.	In	some	cases,	this	means	that	a	previously	prorated	annual	loan	limit	must	be	re-prorated.

Examples	8	and	9	illustrate	the	requirement	described	above.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	8:	Proration	of	the	Loan	Limit	for	a	Student	Who	Graduates	Early	From	a	Clock-Hour Program

A	dependent	student	enrolls	in	a	900	clock-hour	program,	with	the	academic	year	defined	as	900	clock	hours	and 26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	school	assumes	that	the	student	will	complete	900	clock	hours.

The	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	for	a	dependent	first-year	undergraduate	is	$5,500, not	more	than	$3,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized.	The	student	qualifies	to	receive	the	maximum	annual combined	loan	limit	in	the	form	of	a	$3,500	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	and	a	$2,000	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan. Each	loan	is	paid	in	two	equal	disbursements,	as	shown	below.

| Original Direct Subsidized Loan Amount $3,500   | Direct Subsidized Loan First Disbursement $1,750   | Direct Subsidized Loan Second Disbursement $1,750   |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Original Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amount $2,000 | Direct Unsubsidized Loan First Disbursement $1,000 | Direct Unsubsidized Loan Second Disbursement $1,000 |

The	school	considers	the	student	to	have	met	the	requirements	for	graduation	from	the	program	after	the	student has	completed	only	750	of	the	originally	scheduled	900	clock	hours.	As	soon	as	practicable	after	determining	that the	student	will	meet	the	graduation	requirements	after	completing	only	750	clock	hours,	the	school	must	prorate the	student9s	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	because	the	student	is	now	treated	as	having	been	enrolled	in	a program	shorter	than	an	academic	year	in	length	(i.e.,	as	though	the	student	had	originally	enrolled	in	a	750 clock-hour	program).	However,	in	this	circumstance,	only	the	number	of	clock	hours	that	the	student	completed are	used	to	determine	the	prorated	loan	limit.	There	is	no	comparison	of	hours	and	weeks	fractions,	as	is	normally required	when	prorating	the	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limit	for	students	who	are	enrolled	in	programs	shorter	than an	academic	year.

The	school	determines	the	prorated	annual	loan	limit	by	multiplying	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	by	the number	of	clock	hours	the	student	completed,	then	dividing	the	result	by	the	number	of	clock	hours	in	the program's	academic	year	definition:

($5,500	x	750)	÷	900	=	$4,583	prorated	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit

($3,500	x	750)	÷	900	=	$2,917	prorated	subsidized	annual	loan	limit

(As	noted	earlier	in	this	chapter,	the	prorated	loan	limit	may	also	be	determined	by	converting	the	fraction consisting	of	the	number	of	clock	hours	the	student	completed	in	the	program	over	the	number	of	clock	hours	in the	program's	academic	year	to	a	decimal,	and	then	multiplying	the	decimal	by	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit. Whatever	approach	a	school	chooses	should	be	applied	consistently,	as	the	fraction	method	shown	above	and	the decimal	method	may	produce	slightly	different	results.)

The	total	prorated	loan	limit	is	$4,583,	not	more	than	$2,917	of	which	may	be	subsidized.	Because	the	student received	more	than	the	prorated	maximums,	the	school	reduces	each	disbursement	of	the	student9s	Direct Subsidized	Loan	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	as	shown	below	and	returns	the	excess	loan	funds	to	the Department.	Note	that	the	school	3	not	the	student	3	is	responsible	for	returning	the	excess	Direct	Loan	funds	in this	situation.

Volume	8,	Chapter	5,	Example	9:	Re-Proration	of	a	Previously	Prorated	Loan	Limit	for	a	Student	Who	Graduates	Early From	a	Clock-Hour	Program

A	dependent	student	is	enrolled	in	the	remaining	500	clock	hours	of	a	1500	clock-hour	program	that	has	a	defined academic	year	of	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	Because	the	student	is	enrolled	in	a	final period	of	study	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	the	school	prorates	the	annual	loan	limit	based	on	the	500	hours that	it	expects	the	student	to	complete:

($6,500	x	500)	÷	900	=	$3,611	prorated	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit

($4,500	x	500)	÷	900	=	$2,500	prorated	subsidized	annual	loan	limit

The	total	prorated	loan	limit	for	the	remaining	period	of	study	is	$3,611,	not	more	than	$2,500	of	which	may	be subsidized.	The	student	qualifies	to	receive	the	maximum	annual	combined	prorated	loan	limit	in	the	form	of	a $2,500	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	a	$1,111	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan.	Each	loan	is	paid	in	two	equal disbursements,	as	shown	below.

| Original Direct Subsidized Loan Amount $2,500   | Direct Subsidized Loan First Disbursement $1,250   | Direct Subsidized Loan Second Disbursement $1,250   |

| Original Direct Unsubsidized Loan Amount $1,111 | Direct Unsubsidized Loan First Disbursement $556   | Direct Unsubsidized Loan Second Disbursement $555   |

The	student	successfully	meets	the	requirements	for	graduation	from	the	program	after	completing	only	400 clock	hours.	This	means	that	the	school	must	re-prorate	the	annual	loan	limit	based	on	the	400	hours	that	the student	actually	completed:

($6,500	x	400)	÷	900	=	$2,889	re-prorated	combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit

($4,500	x	400)	÷	900	=	$2,000	re-prorated	subsidized	annual	loan	limit

The	total	re-prorated	loan	limit	for	the	remaining	period	of	study	is	$2,889,	not	more	than	$2,000	of	which	may	be subsidized.	Since	the	student	originally	received	Direct	Loan	amounts	in	excess	of	the	re-prorated	loan	limit,	the school	must	adjust	the	original	disbursements	and	return	the	difference	to	the	Department,	as	shown	below.

## Chapter	6

## Monitoring	Annual	Loan	Limit	Progression

## Annual	Loan	Limit	Progression	Overview

The	academic	year	(not	the	award	year)	is	used	as	the	basis	for	monitoring	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limits.	That	is,	a student	may	receive	up	to	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	each	academic	year	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	guidance	on defining	the	academic	year).	Note	that	the	loan	period	for	which	a	Direct	Loan	is	originated	does	not	always	correspond	to the	academic	year.	Although	the	loan	period	is	often	the	same	as	the	academic	year,	it	may	also	be	for	a	period	shorter than	the	academic	year.

For	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans,	a	school	must	use	either	a	Scheduled	Academic	Year	(SAY)	or a	Borrower-Based	Academic	Year	(BBAY)	to	determine	when	a	student	is	eligible	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.	Although there	is	no	fixed	annual	loan	limit	for	Direct	PLUS	Loans,	Direct	PLUS	Loans	are	awarded	for	the	same	SAY	or	BBAY	period that	is	used	for	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans.	The	type	of	academic	year	(SAY	or	BBAY)	that	a school	may	(or	must)	use	to	monitor	annual	loan	limit	progression	depends	on	a	program9s	academic	calendar,	as explained	in	the	sections	that	follow.

## Scheduled	Academic	Year

An	SAY	corresponds	to	a	traditional	academic	year	calendar	that	is	published	in	a	school9s	catalog	or	other	materials	and is	a	fixed	period	of	time	that	generally	begins	and	ends	at	the	same	time	each	year.	An	SAY	may	be	used	by:

- Programs	with	standard	terms	and	a	traditional	academic	calendar;	or
- Programs	with	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	(see	Chapter	3)	and	a	comparable	calendar.

The	guidance	above	also	applies	to	subscription-based	programs	with	standard	terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms.	For more	information	on	academic	calendars	for	subscription-based	programs,	see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1.

Examples	of	SAYs	for	a	standard	term	program	are	fall	and	spring	semesters,	or	fall,	winter,	and	spring	quarters.	If	a program	has	SE9W	nonstandard	terms,	an	SAY	could	consist	of	two	or	more	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	running	from	fall through	spring.	For	both	standard	term	and	SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs,	the	number	of	credit	hours	and	weeks	of instructional	time	in	the	fall	through	spring	SAY	period	must	meet	the	regulatory	requirements	for	an	academic	year.

## SAY	for	Programs	With	Standard	Terms	Using	a	Traditional	Academic	Calendar

As	noted	previously,	an	SAY	corresponds	to	a	traditional	academic	year	calendar	and	usually	begins	and	ends	at	the	same time	each	calendar	year	(for	example,	beginning	on	the	first	day	of	the	fall	semester	and	ending	on	the	last	day	of	the spring	semester).	An	SAY	must	meet	the	Title	IV	requirements	for	an	academic	year	(as	defined	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1). An	SAY	may	include	one	or	more	terms	that	a	student	does	not	attend.

Standard	terms	are	semesters,	trimesters,	or	quarters	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	more	detail	on	standard	terms).	A standard-term	program	may	use	an	SAY	if	it	has	a	traditional	academic	calendar	(i.e.,	has	terms	that	start	and	end	at about	the	same	time	each	year,	such	as	an	academic	calendar	consisting	of	the	fall	and	spring	semesters	or	the	fall, winter,	and	spring	quarters).

Summer	terms	are	generally	not	considered	to	be	part	of	the	SAY,	but	for	purposes	of	monitoring	loan	limits	they	may	be treated	as	a	&lt;trailer=	to	the	preceding	SAY	or	as	a	&lt;header=	to	the	following	SAY.	Your	school	has	the	option	to	establish	a policy	that	designates	its	summer	term	as	either	a	trailer	or	header	to	the	SAY	for	all	students.	You	can	also	choose	to make	different	designations	for	different	educational	programs,	or	for	different	students,	as	long	as	you	ensure	that	there is	no	overlap	in	academic	years.	Note	that	a	fixed	designation	of	the	summer	term	as	either	a	trailer	or	header	can	limit	a student9s	eligibility.	For	instance,	if	you	always	treat	your	summer	term	as	a	trailer	to	a	preceding	fall-spring	SAY,	a student	who	receives	the	full	annual	loan	limit	for	fall-spring	would	have	no	remaining	loan	eligibility	for	summer.

If	the	summer	term	is	split	into	modules	(sometimes	called	&lt;minisessions=),	such	as	&lt;summer	1=	and	&lt;summer	2,=	the modules	can	be	combined	and	treated	as	a	single	trailer	or	header,	or	they	can	be	treated	separately	and	assigned	to different	SAYs.	That	is,	the	first	module	can	be	treated	as	a	trailer	to	the	preceding	fall-spring	SAY,	and	the	second	module treated	as	a	header	to	the	following	fall-spring	SAY.

If	a	term	other	than	the	summer	term	is	divided	into	modules,	the	modules must be	combined	with	each	other	or	with other	terms	and	treated	as	a	single	standard	or	nonstandard	term	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	more	information	on combining	modules).	If	modules	(summer	or	otherwise)	are	grouped	together	and	treated	as	a	single	term,	the	COA cannot	include	costs	for	a	module	for	which	the	student	is	not	expected	to	be	enrolled.	A	student	doesn9t	have	to	be enrolled	in	each	module	but	must	be	able	to	enroll	at	least	half	time	in	the	combined	term.

The	annual	loan	limit	applies	to	the	SAY,	plus	the	summer	trailer	or	header.	For	example,	if	the	SAY	consists	of	fall	and spring	semesters	followed	by	a	summer	trailer,	a	student	may	receive	a	full	annual	loan	limit	for	the	fall-spring-summer period.	Once	the	calendar	period	associated	with	all	terms	in	the	SAY	and	the	summer	header	or	trailer	(if	any)	has elapsed,	a	student	regains	eligibility	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.

SAY	for	Programs	With	SE9W	Nonstandard	Terms	Using	an	Academic	Calendar	Comparable	to	a	Traditional	Academic Calendar

A	program	with	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	may	use	an	SAY	if all the	following	requirements	are	met:

- It	has	a	fixed	academic	calendar	comparable	to	a	traditional	academic	calendar	(i.e.,	terms	that	start	and	end	at about	the	same	time	each	year,	with	the	academic	year	comprised	of	two	or	more	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	in	the fall	through	spring);
- All	the	nonstandard	terms,	including	any	summer	term,	are	SE9W;	and
- The	number	of	credit	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	comparable	fall-spring	academic	calendar	meet	the regulatory	requirements	for	an	academic	year.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	1:	SE9W	SAY

A	school	has	programs	with	an	academic	calendar	using	semester	hours	with	three	12-week	quarters,	offered over	the	fall	through	spring	(comparable	to	a	traditional	academic	year	calendar)	and	a	10-week	term	offered	in the	summer.	The	school	defines	the	academic	year	for	these	programs	as	36	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	24 semester	hours.	Because	the	terms	are	quarters,	but	academic	progress	is	measured	in	semester	hours,	the terms	are	considered	nonstandard.

Because	these	terms	are	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	offered	in	a	fixed	schedule	with	an	academic	calendar comparable	to	a	traditional	calendar,	the	school	may	use	an	SAY	(with	the	summer	term	treated	as	a	trailer	or header)	or	BBAY	1	consisting	of	any	three	consecutive	terms	(see	below)	for	these	programs.

## Borrower-Based	Academic	Year

A	BBAY	does	not	have	fixed	beginning	and	ending	dates.	Instead,	it	&lt;floats=	with	a	student9s	(or	a	group	of	students9) attendance	and	progression	in	a	program	of	study.	There	are	three	types	of	BBAY:

- BBAY	1 ,	for	credit-hour	programs	using	an	SAY	with	standard	terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	(including subscription-based	programs,	as	described	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1).
- BBAY	2 ,	for	credit-hour	programs not using	an	SAY,	with	standard	terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	(including subscription-based	programs,	as	described	in	Volume	3,	Chapter	1).
- BBAY	3 ,	for	clock-hour	programs,	non-term	programs,	programs	with	non-SE9W	nonstandard	terms	(see	Chapter	4 of	this	volume),	or	programs	with	standard	and	nonstandard	terms	not	described	above.

If	a	program	is	offered	in	an	SAY	calendar,	you	have	the	option	of	using	either	an	SAY	or	BBAY	1	to	monitor	the	annual loan	limits	for	students	in	that	program.	You	must	use	a	BBAY	to	monitor	the	annual	loan	limits	for	any	academic	program that	does	not	meet	the	definition	of	a	program	allowed	to	use	an	SAY.	However,	there	are	significant	differences	between the	different	types	of	BBAY.	We	describe	the	differences	between	BBAY	1,	BBAY	2,	and	BBAY	3	in	the	sections	that	follow.

## BBAY	1	for	Credit-Hour	Programs	With	an	SAY

If	a	program	is	offered	in	an	SAY,	you	have	the	option	of	using	a	BBAY	1	as	an	alternative	to	the	SAY	for	monitoring	annual loan	limit	progression.	As	explained	earlier,	a	BBAY	is	not	a	fixed	period	that	begins	and	ends	at	the	same	time	each	year. The	beginning	and	ending	dates	depend	on	the	individual	student9s	enrollment.

For	programs	with	an	SAY,	a	BBAY	1	must	include	the	same	number	of	terms	as	the	SAY	that	would	otherwise	be	used (not	counting	any	summer	trailer	or	header).	For	example,	if	the	SAY	includes	three	quarters	(fall,	winter,	spring),	a	BBAY 1	would	consist	of	any	three	consecutive	terms.	A	BBAY	1	may	include	terms	the	student	does	not	attend	if	the	student could	have	enrolled at	least	half	time in	those	terms,	but	(unlike	an	SAY)	it	must	begin	with	a	term	in	which	the	student is	enrolled	(even	though	the	student	may	be	enrolled	less	than	half	time	for	the	first	term	and	not	eligible	for	a	loan	for that	term).	Also,	any	modules	(summer	or	otherwise)	that	run	consecutively	within	a	term must be	combined	and	treated as	a	single	term.	The	COA	cannot	include	costs	for	a	module	for	which	the	student	is	not	expected	to	be	enrolled.	A student	doesn9t	have	to	be	enrolled	in	each	module	but	must	be	able	to	enroll	at	least	half	time	in	the	combined	term.

Like	an	SAY,	a	BBAY	1	must	meet	the	minimum	Title	IV	requirements	for	an	academic	year.	However,	a	BBAY	1	that includes	a	summer	term	may	include	fewer	than	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	or	fewer	credit	hours	than	the	minimum number	required	for	an	SAY.	This	is	because	a	summer	term	may	be	shorter	than	a	standard	term	in	an	SAY	but	is recognized	as	academically	equivalent	to	a	standard	term	when	used	as	one	of	the	terms	in	a	BBAY	1.	This	exception applies only to	a	BBAY	1	used	as	an	alternative	for	a	program	with	an	SAY.

You	may	use	a	BBAY	1	for	all	students,	only	for	students	in	certain	programs,	or	on	a	student-by-student	basis.	For example,	you	could	use	a	BBAY	1	for	students	enrolled	in	a	program	that	begins	in	a	term	other	than	the	first	term	of	the SAY.	You	can	even	alternate	BBAY	1	and	SAY	for	a	student,	provided	the	academic	years	don9t	overlap.	This	treatment may	allow	a	student	to	receive	another	loan	sooner	than	would	be	allowed	under	an	SAY	standard.

As	with	an	SAY,	the	annual	loan	limit	applies	to	the	BBAY	1.	Once	the	calendar	period	associated	with	all	terms	in	the BBAY	1	has	elapsed,	a	student	regains	eligibility	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.

## Alternating	an	SAY	With	BBAY	1

Alternating	an	SAY	with	BBAY	1	may	allow	a	student	to	receive	another	loan	sooner	than	would	be	allowed	with	an	SAY. For	instance,	if	you	normally	use	an	SAY	consisting	of	fall	and	spring	semesters	with	a	summer	trailer,	a	student	who received	the	maximum	annual	loan	limit	for	fall-spring	could	not	receive	another	loan	until	the	start	of	a	new	SAY	in	the fall.	If	the	student	enrolls	for	summer	and	wants	a	loan,	you	could	choose	to	switch	the	student	to	a	BBAY	1	consisting	of the	summer	and	fall	terms.	The	student	could	then	receive	a	loan	for	the	summer	term,	which	would	be	the	start	of	a	new academic	year.	A	school	that	provides	flexibility	in	academic	year	standards	for	purposes	of	monitoring	annual	loan	limits must	have	a	written	policy	that	explains	how	it	applies	this	flexibility	when	determining	loan	eligibility.

Examples	2	through	5	illustrate	the	optional	use	of	BBAY	1	for	a	program	that	is	offered	in	an	SAY.	Note	that	in	each example	the	first	BBAY	1	is	the	same	as	the	SAY.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	2:	BBAY	1	Where	the	SAY	Contains	Two	Semesters

| Year 1: SAY or BBAY 1   | Year 2: BBAY 1   | Year 3: BBAY 1   |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Fall + Spring           | Summer + Fall    | Spring + Summer  |

In	Example	2,	the	initial	fall	and	spring	terms	could	be	considered	either	an	SAY	or	BBAY	1.	If	the	student	attends the	summer	session	at	the	school,	the	school	can	choose	to	treat	the	summer	term	and	the	next	fall	as	a	BBAY	1 for	the	student.	In	that	case,	the	following	spring	and	summer	would	also	constitute	a	BBAY	1.	The	maximum	loan limit	for	an	academic	year	applies	to	each	BBAY	1.	If	these	were	the	first	three	years	of	study	for	a	dependent student	who	progressed	a	grade	level	each	academic	year,	the	student	would	be	eligible	for	up	to	the	applicable annual	loan	limit	during	each	BBAY	1.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	3:	BBAY	1	Where	the	SAY	Contains	Two	Semesters	(Student	Is	Not	Enrolled	in	the Second	Term	of	the	BBAY)

| Year 1: SAY or BBAY 1   | Year 2: BBAY 1                       | Year 3: BBAY 1   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|
| Fall + Spring           | Summer + Fall (not enrolled in Fall) | Spring + Summer  |

A	student	doesn9t	have	to	attend	all	of	the	terms	in	a	BBAY	1,	but	the	BBAY	1	cannot	begin	with	a	term	that	the student	doesn9t	attend.	In	Example	3,	the	student	is	not	enrolled	in	the	second	term	(fall)	of	year	2.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	4:	BBAY	1	Where	the	SAY	Contains	Two	Semesters	(Student	Is	Not	Enrolled	in	a	Term That	Would	Otherwise	Be	the	First	Term	in	the	BBAY)

| Year 1: SAY or BBAY 1   | Year 2: BBAY 1   |                       | Year 3: BBAY 1   |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Fall + Spring           | Summer + Fall    | Spring (not enrolled) | Summer + Fall    |

In	Example	4,	if	the	student	does	not	attend	a	term	that	otherwise	would	have	been	the	beginning	of	a	BBAY	1	(in this	case,	spring),	then	the	student9s	next	BBAY	1	cannot	begin	until	the	next	term	that	the	student	attends	(in this	case,	summer).	As	with	Examples	2	and	3,	the	annual	loan	limit	applies	to	each	BBAY	1.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	5:	BBAY	1	Where	the	SAY	Contains	Three	Quarters

| Year 1: SAY or BBAY 1   | Year 2: BBAY 1         |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Fall + Winter + Spring  | Summer + Fall + Winter |

The	same	concepts	apply	to	quarter-term	programs.	For	instance,	in	Example	5,	the	fall,	winter,	and	spring	terms constitute	the	school9s	SAY.	If	the	student	attends	the	summer	session	at	the	school,	it	can	be	the	first	term	of	a BBAY	1	that	also	includes	the	following	fall	and	winter	terms.

BBAY	2	for	Standard-Term	Programs	and	SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Programs	Without	an	SAY

If	a	program	with	standard	terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms	is	not	offered	in	a	traditional	academic	year	calendar	(SAY), BBAY	2 must be	used.	If	the	program	uses	semesters	or	trimesters,	a	BBAY	2	consists	of	any	two	consecutive	terms.	If	the program	uses	quarters,	a	BBAY	2	consists	of	any	three	consecutive	terms.	If	the	program	uses	SE9W	nonstandard	terms, a	BBAY	2	consists	of	the	number	of	consecutive	terms	that	coincide	with	the	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program9s academic	year.

As	with	the	optional	BBAY	1	that	may	be	used	for	programs	with	an	SAY,	BBAY	2	may	include	terms	that	a	student	does not	attend	(as	long	as	the	student	could	have	enrolled	at	least	half	time	in	those	terms),	but	it	must	begin	with	a	term	in which	the	student	is	enrolled	(even	if	the	student	is	enrolled	less	than	half	time	during	the	first	term	and	therefore ineligible	to	receive	a	Direct	Loan	for	that	term).	Unlike	the	optional	BBAY	1	for	programs	offered	in	an	SAY,	there	is	no exception	to	the	minimum	academic	year	requirements	for	a	BBAY	2	that	includes	a	summer	term.	This	means	that	the BBAY	2	for	standard-term	programs	that	are	not	offered	in	a	traditional	academic	calendar,	or	for	SE9W	nonstandard	term programs	not	offered	in	a	comparable	academic	calendar,	must	always	include	enough	terms	to	meet	the	minimum	Title IV	academic	year	requirements	for	weeks	of	instructional	time.

As	with	BBAY	1,	any	modules	(summer	or	otherwise)	that	run	consecutively	within	a	term must be	combined	and	treated as	a	single	term.	The	COA	cannot	include	costs	for	a	module	for	which	the	student	is	not	expected	to	be	enrolled.	A student	doesn9t	have	to	be	enrolled	in	each	module	but	must	be	able	to	enroll	at	least	half	time	in	the	combined	term.

The	annual	loan	limit	applies	to	the	BBAY	2.	Once	the	calendar	period	associated	with	all	of	the	terms	in	the	BBAY	2	has elapsed,	a	student	regains	eligibility	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	6:	BBAY	2

| First BBAY 2            | Second BBAY 2                                        | Third BBAY 2            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Semester 1 + Semester 2 | Semester 3 + Semester 4 (not enrolled in Semester 4) | Semester 5 + Semester 6 |

A	school	has	a	program	that	measures	academic	progress	in	credit	hours	and	uses	15-week	semesters,	but	it	is not	offered	in	a	traditional	academic	year	calendar	(SAY).	New	students	begin	the	program	each	month,	and	a	15week	semester	begins	at	that	time	for	that	cohort	of	students.	The	school	must	use	BBAY	2	to	monitor	annual loan	limits.	A	BBAY	2	consists	of	any	two	consecutive	semesters,	beginning	with	a	semester	in	which	a	student	is enrolled.	In	Example	6,	the	student	is	not	enrolled	in	the	second	semester	(Semester	4)	of	the	second	BBAY	2.

BBAY	3	for	Clock-Hour,	Non-Term	Credit-Hour,	and	Non-SE9W	Nonstandard-Term	Programs

All	clock-hour	programs,	non-term	credit-hour	programs,	and	non-SE9W	nonstandard-term	programs	must	use	a	BBAY	3 that	meets	the	minimum	requirements	for	an	academic	year.	That	is,	the	BBAY	3	must	contain	at	least	30	weeks	(or,	for clock-hour	programs,	26	weeks)	of	instructional	time	and:

- For	undergraduate	programs,	a	minimum	of	24	semester	or	trimester	hours,	36	quarter	hours,	or	900	clock	hours;	or
- For	graduate	programs,	at	least	the	number	of	hours	a	student	would	complete	under	the	school9s	full-time	standard in	weeks	of	the	Title	IV	academic	year,	which	must	be	a	minimum	of	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	for	credit-hour programs,	or	at	least	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	for	clock-hour	programs.

The	BBAY	3	begins	when	a	student	enrolls	and	does	not	end	until the	later	of the	date	the	student	successfully completes	the	hours	in	the	academic	year	or	the	number	of	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	academic	year.	Because	a student	must	successfully	complete	the	minimum	number	of	hours	or	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	an	academic	year (whichever	comes	later)	before	a	new	BBAY	3	begins,	a	student9s	enrollment	status	may	affect	how	soon	the	student regains	eligibility	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.	For	example,	a	student	who	is	attending	less	than	full	time	will	take	longer to	complete	a	BBAY	3	than	a	full-time	student.	(In	contrast,	an	SAY,	BBAY	1,	or	BBAY	2	ends	when	the	calendar	period associated	with	the	terms	in	the	SAY	or	BBAY	has	elapsed,	regardless	of	how	many	credit	hours	or	weeks	of	instruction the	student	completed	during	the	SAY	or	BBAY.)

## Individual	Academic	Progress	in	BBAY	3

In	many	clock-hour,	non-term,	and	nonstandard-term	programs,	students	are	allowed	to	progress	at	an	individual	pace. For	example,	consider	a	school	that	defines	its	academic	year	as	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	and offers	a	900	clock-hour	program	that	most	students	complete	in	26	weeks.	However,	one	student	might	complete	900 clock	hours	in	22	weeks,	and	another	in	30	weeks.

As	we	explained	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume,	the	annual	loan	limit	must	be	prorated	(reduced)	if	an	undergraduate student	is	enrolled	in	a	program	that	is	less	than	a	full	academic	year	in	length	or	is	in	a	remaining	period	of	study	that	is shorter	than	a	full	academic	year.	However,	in	the	scenario	described	above,	you	do	not	have	to	prorate	the	loan	limit	for the	occasional	student	who	completes	the	program	in	fewer	than	26	weeks.	This	policy	applies	only	to	programs	that	are exactly	one	academic	year	in	length.	If	a	program	is	longer	than	an	academic	year,	proration	may	be	required	for	a	loan covering	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program	if	a	student	completes	more	than	the	minimum	number	of	hours	during	the first	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	(see	Example	7	in	Chapter	5	of	this	volume).

## BBAY	3	for	Programs	With	Both	Standard	and	Nonstandard	Terms

BBAY	3	must	also	be	used	if	a	program	has	both	standard	terms	and	nonstandard	terms	and	does	not	qualify	to	use	an SAY.	For	example,	if	you	offer	a	program	with	a	4-week	intersession	between	a	15-week	fall	semester	and	a	15-week spring	semester,	and	you	do	not	combine	the	intersession	with	one	of	the	standard	terms	but	instead	treat	it	as	a standalone	nonstandard	term,	you	must	use	BBAY	3	to	monitor	annual	loan	limit	progression.	In	this	circumstance	you cannot	simply	ignore	the	intersession	and	consider	the	program	to	be	offered	only	in	standard	terms.	In	contrast,	if	you combine	the	intersession	with	one	of	the	semesters,	you	could	use	an	SAY	consisting	of	the	fall	and	spring	semesters.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	7:	BBAY	3	for	a	Clock-Hour	Program

A	school	has	an	1,800	clock-hour	program	with	52	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	defines	its	academic	year	as 900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	first	BBAY	3	begins	with	a	student9s	initial	enrollment date	and	ends	when	the	student	has	successfully	completed	the	first	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of instructional	time	in	the	program,	whichever	comes	later.

The	second	BBAY	3	would	be	the	period	of	time	it	takes	the	student	to	successfully	complete	the	final	900	hours and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	in	the	program.	A	student	who	completes	the	first	900	hours	in	less	than	26 weeks	must	still	complete	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	before	the	second	BBAY	3	begins.	Similarly,	a	student who	has	completed	fewer	than	900	clock	hours	after	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	must	successfully	complete 900	hours	before	the	second	BBAY	3	begins.

During	the	first	BBAY	3,	the	student	may	receive	up	to	the	full	annual	loan	limit	for	a	first-year	undergraduate. The	student	becomes	eligible	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit	(at	the	second-year	undergraduate	level)	when	the second	BBAY	3	begins.

The	principles	described	in	this	example	for	a	clock-hour	program	also	apply	to	non-term	credit-hour	programs	or non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	credit-hour	programs.	For	example,	if	a	school	offers	a	non-term	48	semester	hour, 60	weeks	of	instructional	time	program	with	a	defined	academic	year	of	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of instructional	time,	the	second	BBAY	3	would	not	begin	until	a	student	has	successfully	completed	the	first	24 semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.

Similarly,	in	a	72	quarter-hour	program	with	60	weeks	of	instructional	time	offered	in	a	series	of	non-SE9W nonstandard	terms,	with	a	defined	academic	year	of	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time,	the second	BBAY	3	would	not	begin	until	a	student	has	successfully	completed	the	first	36	quarter	hours	and	30 weeks	of	instructional	time,	whichever	comes	later,	regardless	of	the	number	of	terms	that	have	elapsed.	For instance,	a	student	who	successfully	completes	only	33	quarter	hours	in	the	first	30	weeks	of	instructional	time must	successfully	complete	an	additional	three	quarter	hours	before	the	second	BBAY	3	begins	and	the	student becomes	eligible	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit	at	the	second-year	undergraduate	level.

Annual	Loan	Limit	Increase	Based	on	Grade	Level	Progression	or	Dependency	Status	Change

The	annual	loan	limit	for	Direct	Subsidized	and	Unsubsidized	Loans	increases	as	a	student	progresses	in	grade	level. Generally,	a	student9s	grade	level	for	loan	limit	purposes	is	set	according	to	the	school9s	academic	standards.

While	the	law	defines	minimum	coursework	for	an	academic	year,	it	doesn9t	define	how	much	coursework	a	student	must complete	to	progress	from	one	grade	level	to	another.	Unless	a	student9s	program	of	study	or	a	school9s	academic standards	clearly	specify	when	this	grade-level	progression	takes	place,	a	reasonable	approach	would	be	to	base	grade levels	on	the	number	of	credits	required	for	the	program,	divided	by	the	number	of	academic	years	it	takes	a	typical student	to	earn	that	number	of	credits.	For	instance,	if	your	school	has	a	baccalaureate	program	that	requires	120 semester	hours	of	work	and	is	typically	completed	in	four	academic	years,	then	you	might	use	a	standard	of	30	hours completed	at	each	grade	level.

Standard	Term	and	SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Programs:	Grade	Level	Progression	Within	the	Same	Academic	Year

In	standard	term	programs	or	SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs,	a	student	who	has	already	received	the	full	annual	limit within	an	academic	year	can	receive	additional	loan	funds	if	the	student	progresses	to	a	grade	level	with	a	higher	annual loan	limit	during	that	same	academic	year.	(See	Volume	3,	Chapter	1	for	a	discussion	of	academic	year	requirements.)

Increasing	the	Loan	Amount	When	a	Student9s	Grade	Level	Changes	During	an	Academic	Year

There	are	two	options	for	awarding	an	additional	loan	amount	when	a	student	progresses	to	a	grade	level	with	a	higher annual	loan	limit	during	an	academic	year:

- 1.	 Originate	a	new	loan	at	the	new	grade	level	for	the	difference	between	the	new	loan	limit	and	the	amount	of	the	first loan.	The	loan	period	for	the	new	loan	must	correspond	to	the	term(s)	during	which	the	student	qualifies	for	the higher	loan	limit.	You	could	also	choose	to	cancel	any	pending	disbursements	of	the	first	loan	and	originate	a	new loan	for	an	amount	equal	to	the	canceled	disbursements	of	the	first	loan	plus	the	additional	amount	for	which	the student	is	eligible	due	to	the	grade	level	change.
- 2.	 Adjust	the	amount	of	the	current	loan.	Change	the	grade	level	in	the	loan	record	and	increase	the	amount	of	the existing	loan	to	the	new	amount.

With	either	option,	the	student9s	remaining	loan	eligibility	must	be	calculated	using	only	the	COA	and	OFA	for	the	term(s) during	which	the	student	qualifies	for	the	higher	loan	limit.

As	a	reminder,	a	student	can	progress	to	a	higher	grade	level	during	an	academic	year	only	in	a	program	with	standard terms	or	SE9W	nonstandard	terms.

Volume	8,	Chapter	6,	Example	8:	Grade-Level	Progression	Within	the	Same	SAY

A	dependent	second-year	undergraduate	student	qualifies	for	the	maximum	annual	combined	subsidized	and unsubsidized	annual	loan	limit	of	$6,500,	not	more	than	$4,500	of	which	may	be	subsidized.	For	purposes	of	this example,	assume	that	the	student	is	eligible	to	receive	the	maximum	$4,500	in	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	and the	remaining	$2,000	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds.	The	student	receives	a	first	disbursement	of	$2,250	in Direct	Subsidized	Loan	funds	and	$1,000	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	at	the	beginning	of	the	fall	semester of	a	fall-spring	SAY.

Based	on	the	coursework	completed	during	the	fall	semester,	the	student	progresses	to	third-year	academic status	at	the	beginning	of	the	spring	semester.	The	student	now	qualifies	for	the	$7,500	combined	subsidized	and unsubsidized	annual	limit	(maximum	$5,500	subsidized)	that	applies	to	third-year	and	beyond	dependent undergraduates.	If	otherwise	eligible,	for	the	spring	term	the	student	could	receive	up	to	the	difference	between the	amount	already	received	in	the	fall	and	the	new	annual	limit	in	the	spring	term.	If	the	student	again	qualifies for	the	maximum	subsidized	loan	amount,	eligibility	for	the	spring	term	is	as	follows:

$5,500	-	$2,250	subsidized	received	in	the	fall	=	$3,250	subsidized	eligibility	for	spring;	and

$2,000	-	$1,000	unsubsidized	received	in	the	fall	=	$1,000	additional	unsubsidized	eligibility	for	spring.

However,	only	the	COA	and	OFA	associated	with	the	spring	term	can	be	used	in	determining	the	student9s eligibility	for	the	additional	loan	amount	in	that	term.	The	COA	and	OFA	for	the	fall	term	cannot	be	considered. The	school	may	either	originate	a	new	spring-only	subsidized	loan	for	the	additional	subsidized	loan	eligibility	in the	spring	term	(note	that	the	grade	level	progression	does	not	increase	the	student9s	additional	unsubsidized eligibility)	or	may	increase	the	amount	of	the	original	fall-spring	subsidized	loan	and	make	the	appropriate adjustment	to	the	second	disbursement	of	that	loan.

Clock-Hour,	Non-Term	Credit	Hour,	and	Non-SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Programs:	Grade	Level	Progression	Occurs	Only	at the	Beginning	of	a	New	BBAY	3

In	contrast	to	standard	term	and	SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs,	progression	to	a	higher	grade	level	and	the beginning	of	a	new	BBAY	3	for	loan	limit	purposes	always	happens	at	the	same	time	for	a	student	in	a	clock-hour	program, non-term	program,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard-term	program.	To	advance	to	the	next	grade	level	for	annual	loan	limit purposes,	a	student	must	successfully	complete	both	the	weeks	and	hours	in	the	program9s	Title	IV	academic	year.	That is,	the	student	must	complete	at	least	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	(or,	for	clock-hour	programs,	at	least	26	weeks)	and the	number	of	credit	or	clock	hours	in	the	academic	year,	whichever	comes	later.	For	instance,	a	first-year	student	in	a two-year	non-term	program	with	a	defined	academic	year	of	36	quarter	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time	who earns	36	quarter	credits	over	24	weeks	of	instructional	time	cannot	progress	to	the	next	grade	level	(and	begin	a	new BBAY	3	for	annual	loan	limit	purposes)	until	another	six	weeks	of	instructional	time	are	completed.

## New	Annual	Loan	Limit	at	the	Same	Grade	Level

The	beginning	of	a	new	academic	year	for	annual	loan	limit	purposes	does	not	always	coincide	with	a	student9s progression	to	a	higher	grade	level.	For	both	standard-term	programs	and	SE9W	nonstandard	term	programs,	if	a	student is	enrolled	at	the	same	grade	level	after	a	full	academic	year	has	elapsed,	the	student	may	be	eligible	for	a	new	annual maximum	amount	at	the	same	grade	level,	provided	that	the	student	maintains	satisfactory	academic	progress.	For example,	a	student	in	a	standard	term	or	SE9W	nonstandard	term	program	who	completes	only	12	semester	hours	during the	first	SAY,	BBAY	1,	or	BBAY	2	could	receive	another	loan	when	the	calendar	period	associated	with	that	academic	year has	elapsed,	but	the	borrower	would	still	be	classified	as	a	first-year	undergraduate	at	the	start	of	the	second	academic year.

If	a	student	is	maintaining	satisfactory	academic	progress,	a	school	may	not	have	a	general	policy	that	limits	the	number of	times	the	student	can	receive	the	maximum	annual	loan	limit	at	one	grade	level.	A	school	may	refuse	to	originate	a loan	or	may	originate	a	loan	for	an	amount	less	than	the	borrower9s	maximum	eligibility	only	on	a	case-by-case	basis	(see &lt;Refusing	to	Originate	a	Loan	or	Originating	for	Less	Than	Maximum	Eligibility=	in	Chapter	1	of	this	volume).

## Remedial	Work	and	Grade	Level	Progression

Remedial	coursework	can	be	counted	towards	a	student9s	grade	level	progression,	but	only	if	the	school9s	written	and officially	approved	academic	grade	level	progression	policy	specifies	that	remedial	coursework	can	be	counted	for	this purpose.	For	instance,	a	school	might	have	a	policy	stating	that	a	student	must	complete	30	semester	hours	to	progress to	a	second-year	grade	level	and	specifying	that	up	to	10	of	those	hours	may	be	in	the	form	of	remedial	coursework.

Increasing	the	Loan	Amount	When	a	Student9s	Dependency	Status	Changes	During	the	Academic	Year

For	any	type	of	educational	program	(whether	term-based	or	non-term,	credit-hour	or	clock-hour),	a	dependent	student who	has	already	borrowed	up	to	the	annual	loan	limit	within	an	academic	year	may	be	eligible	to	receive	additional	loan funds	if	their	dependency	status	changes	to	independent	during	that	same	academic	year.

## Chapter	7

## Annual	Loan	Limits	for	Students	Who	Transfer	or	Change	Programs

## Overview

The	Direct	Loan	annual	loan	limits	apply	to	an	academic	year.	If	a	student	who	received	a	Direct	Loan	transfers	from	one school	to	another	school,	or	changes	to	a	different	program	at	the	same	school,	and	there	is	an	overlap	between	the academic	year	associated	with	the	loan	received	at	the	first	school	or	for	the	first	program	and	the	academic	year	for	the new	school	or	program,	this	overlap	may	affect	the	amount	that	the	student	is	initially	eligible	to	borrow	at	the	new	school or	for	the	new	program.

An	overlap	in	academic	years	exists	if	the	academic	year	at	the	new	school	(or	the	academic	year	for	the	new	program	at the	same	school)	begins	before	the	calendar	end	date	of	the	academic	year	at	the	prior	school	or	program.	In	the	case	of a	transfer	student	from	another	school,	you	may	obtain	documentation	from	the	prior	school	of	the	specific	beginning	and ending	dates	for	the	prior	academic	year,	or	look	for	the	academic	year	dates	of	Direct	Loans	originated	by	the	prior school	on	the	&lt;award	detail	information	page=	in	the	COD	Web	interface.

Transfer	Into	a	Standard	Term	or	SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Program	(SAY,	BBAY	1,	or	BBAY	2)

## Transfers	Between	Schools

Example	1	below	illustrates	the	determination	of	the	annual	loan	limit	for	a	student	who	transfers	from	one	school	into	a standard-term	program	at	another	school	with	an	overlap	in	academic	years.

Volume	8,	Chapter	7,	Example	1:	Transfer	Into	a	Standard-Term	Program

A	student	receives	a	$2,000	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	at	School	A	for	a	loan	period	from	May	1	to	August	31.	School A	reports	the	academic	year	for	this	loan	as	May	1	to	November	27.	The	student,	a	dependent	undergraduate, transfers	to	a	program	at	School	B	in	September	and	is	admitted	at	grade	level	2.	The	student	requests	a	loan	for the	fall	and	spring	semesters	(September-May).	The	program	at	School	B	uses	an	SAY	consisting	of	fall	and	spring semesters,	followed	by	a	summer	trailer	term.

Because	the	academic	year	at	School	B	begins	before	the	end	of	the	academic	year	at	School	A,	the	student	may initially	receive	only	up	to	a	maximum	of	$4,500	for	the	fall	semester	at	School	B,	not	more	than	$2,500	of	which may	be	subsidized.	This	amount	represents	the	difference	between	the	annual	loan	limit	of	$6,500	(maximum $4,500	subsidized),	and	the	amount	received	at	School	A	($2,000	subsidized)	for	the	overlapping	academic	year period.

The	initial	loan	period	at	School	B	corresponds	with	the	fall	term.	If	the	student	receives	the	maximum	of	$4,500 for	the	fall	semester,	at	the	start	of	the	spring	semester	in	January	the	student	may	borrow	up	to	an	additional $2,000	(the	difference	between	the	second-year	dependent	undergraduate	annual	loan	limit	and	the	amount already	borrowed	for	the	fall-spring	academic	year	at	School	B).	If	the	student	received	the	maximum	$2,500	in subsidized	loan	funds	for	the	fall	term,	the	additional	$2,000	would	be	limited	to	unsubsidized	loan	funds.

As	an	alternative,	School	B	could	choose	to	change	the	student	from	an	SAY	schedule	to	a	BBAY	1	schedule beginning	with	the	spring	semester.	The	student	would	then	be	eligible	to	borrow	up	to	the	full	annual	loan	limit for	a	spring-summer	BBAY	1.	Although	this	might	appear	to	result	in	an	overlap	between	the	SAY	and	BBAY	1	at School	B,	in	this	limited	transfer	student	circumstance	the	fall	semester	at	School	B	can	be	considered	the	last term	of	the	academic	year	that	began	at	School	A.

Transfers	Between	Programs	at	the	Same	School

year,	the	student9s	loan	eligibility	for	the	remaining	term(s)	of	the	academic	year	is	equal	to	the	difference	between	the applicable	loan	limit	for	the	new	program	and	the	loan	amount	the	student	received	for	the	prior	program	within	the	same academic	year.

Transfer	Into	a	Clock-Hour,	Non-Term,	or	Non-SE9W	Nonstandard	Term	Program	(BBAY	3):	Abbreviated	Loan	Periods

## Transfers	Between	Schools

If	a	student	transfers	into	a	clock-hour,	non-term,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	program	at	a	new	school	and	the academic	year	associated	with	the	last	loan	the	student	received	at	the	prior	school	overlaps	the	initial	academic	year	for the	program	at	the	new	school,	the	new	school	may	originate	an	initial	loan	for	a	loan	period	that	covers	the	remaining portion	of	the	academic	year	that	began	at	the	prior	school.	The	loan	period	for	this	initial	loan	is	called	an	&lt;abbreviated loan	period=	because	it	is	shorter	than	the	loan	period	that	would	otherwise	be	required	under	the	normal	minimum	loan period	requirements.	As	explained	earlier	in	this	volume,	under	normal	rules	the	minimum	loan	period	for	a	clock-hour, non-term,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	program	is	the	lesser	of:

- The	academic	year;	or
- The	length	of	the	program	or	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program.

The	new	school	may	originate	a	loan	for	an	abbreviated	loan	period	regardless	of	whether	the	new	school	accepts	transfer hours	from	the	prior	school.	The	abbreviated	loan	period	begins	with	the	date	of	the	student9s	enrollment	at	the	new school	and	ends	on	the calendar	period	ending	date of	the	academic	year	that	began	at	the	prior	school,	without regard	to	the	number	of	credit	or	clock	hours	or	weeks	of	instructional	time	that	the	student	has	completed	during	the abbreviated	loan	period.	After	the	abbreviated	loan	period	is	completed,	the	student	progresses	to	a	new	loan	period	and academic	year	(BBAY	3)	and	a	new	annual	loan	limit.

If	the	new	school	accepts	credits	or	hours	from	the	prior	school,	this	may	give	the	student	advance	standing	that	reduces the	length	of	time	it	will	take	to	complete	the	program	at	the	new	school.	If	the	remaining	portion	of	the	program	at	the new	school	following	the	completion	of	the	abbreviated	loan	period	is	shorter	than	an	academic	year,	the	annual	loan	limit for	the	next	loan	must	be	prorated.

Generally,	the	loan	amount	for	the	abbreviated	loan	period	at	the	new	school	may	not	exceed	the	remaining	balance	of the	full	annual	loan	limit	applicable	to	the	student	at	the	new	school,	minus	the	loan	amount	the	student	received	at	the first	school	for	the	same	academic	year.	However,	there	is	an	exception	to	this	general	rule	if:

- The	student	is	transferring	into	a	program	at	the	new	school	that	is	less	than	a	full	academic	year	in	length;	or
- The	student	is	transferring	into	a	remaining	portion	of	a	program	(of	any	length)	that	is	less	than	an	academic	year	in length.

In	the	two	circumstances	described	above,	the	total	loan	amount	that	the	student	may	receive	for	the	program	(or remaining	portion	of	the	program)	at	the	new	school	(for	the	abbreviated	loan	period	and	any	subsequent	loan	period combined)	may	not	exceed	the	applicable	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	the	program	or	remaining	portion	of	the	program.

## Rules	for	Abbreviated	Loan	Periods:

- The	abbreviated	loan	period	begins	when	the	student	starts	at	the	new	school.
- The	abbreviated	loan	period	ends	when	the	academic	year	would	have	ended	at	the	prior	school,	without	regard	to how	many	hours	or	weeks	of	instructional	time	the	student	has	completed	at	the	new	school	during	the	abbreviated loan	period.
- Generally,	the	maximum	loan	amount	that	the	student	can	receive	for	the	abbreviated	loan	period	is	the	difference between	the	full	annual	loan	limit	applicable	to	the	student	at	the	new	school	and	the	loan	amount	that	was disbursed	at	the	prior	school	during	the	overlapping	academic	year	(see	the	preceding	discussion	for	an	exception	to this	general	rule).
- The	first	disbursement	of	the	loan	for	the	abbreviated	loan	period	at	the	new	school	is	made	at	the	beginning	of	the abbreviated	loan	period.	Unless	the	school	qualifies	based	on	its	cohort	default	rate	for	the	exemption	from	the multiple	disbursement	requirement	(see	Volume	3,	Chapter	1),	the	loan	must	be	disbursed	in	at	least	two

installments,	with	the	second	disbursement	made	at	the	calendar	midpoint	of	the	abbreviated	loan	period	regardless of	how	many	clock	or	credit	hours	or	weeks	of	instructional	time	have	been	completed.	The	normal	payment	period disbursement	rules	do	not	apply	in	this	situation.

- The	next	loan	period	and	a	new	BBAY	3	at	the	new	school	begins	the	day	after	the	last	day	of	the	abbreviated	loan period.
- Once	the	new	loan	period	and	BBAY	3	begin,	all	normal	rules	for	the	timing	of	disbursements	and	annual	loan	limit progression	apply.

Exceptions	to	the	Minimum	Loan	Period	Rules	(Abbreviated	Loan	Periods)

## 34	CFR	685.301(a)(10)(ii),	(iii)

Examples	2	and	3	illustrate	the	principles	described	above.	Although	this	is	not	shown	in	the	abbreviated	loan	period examples,	in	some	cases	a	student	who	transfers	into	a	program	after	having	received	a	loan	at	another	school	for	an overlapping	academic	year	may	be	eligible	to	receive	a	higher	total	loan	amount	for	the	program	at	the	new	school	than	a non-transfer	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive	for	that	same	program.	In	other	cases,	a	transfer	student	may	be	eligible to	receive	a	lower	total	loan	amount	for	the	same	program	than	a	non-transfer	student.	The	total	loan	amount	that	a transfer	student	may	receive	depends	on	factors	such	as	the	length	of	the	program	at	the	second	school,	the	program9s COA,	and	the	loan	amount	the	transfer	student	received	at	the	prior	school	for	the	overlapping	academic	year.

Volume	8,	Chapter	7,	Example	2:	Transfer	Into	a	Clock-Hour	Program	One	Academic	Year	or	Greater	in	Length

A	dependent	first-year	undergraduate	student	receives	the	first	disbursement	($2,750)	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan	at	School	A.	The	loan	period	and	academic	year	dates	are	April	1	to	December	31.	For	purposes	of	this example,	assume	that	the	student	has	no	financial	need	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	receives	only	Direct Unsubsidized	Loans.	The	student	transfers	from	School	A	to	an	1,800	clock-hour	program	at	School	B	and	begins attendance	on	June	25.	The	student	is	still	classified	as	a	dependent	first-year	undergraduate.	The	program	at School	B	has	an	academic	year	of	26	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	900	clock	hours.

The	student9s	first	loan	period	at	School	B	will	be	an	abbreviated	loan	period	from	June	25	(the	beginning	date	of attendance	at	School	B)	through	December	31	(the	date	the	academic	year	would	have	ended	at	School	A).	For the	initial	abbreviated	loan	period,	School	B	may	originate	a	loan	for	up	to	the	difference	between	the	student9s annual	loan	limit	($5,500)	and	the	loan	already	received	at	School	A	for	the	overlapping	loan	period	($2,750).	The loan	amount	available	to	the	student	during	the	abbreviated	loan	period	is	$2,750.

On	January	1,	the	day	after	the	last	day	of	the	abbreviated	loan	period,	a	new	BBAY	3	begins,	and	the	student becomes	eligible	for	a	new	annual	loan	limit.	The	loan	period	for	the	new	loan	the	student	receives	following	the completion	of	the	abbreviated	loan	period	will	correspond	to	the	lesser	of	the	academic	year	or	the	remainder	of the	program	at	School	B.	If	there	is	less	than	a	full	academic	year	of	the	program	remaining	after	the	abbreviated loan	period	has	ended,	the	loan	limit	for	the	new	loan	must	be	prorated.

Volume	8,	Chapter	7,	Example	3:	Transfer	Into	a	Clock-Hour	Program	Shorter	Than	an	Academic	Year

A	dependent	first-year	undergraduate	student	receives	the	first	disbursements	of	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan ($1,750)	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	($1,000)	at	School	A.	The	loan	period	and	academic	year	dates	are	January 26	to	July	31.

The	student	leaves	School	A	and	transfers	into	a	300	clock-hour/12-week	program	at	School	B	on	June	15.	School B	defines	its	Title	IV	academic	year	as	containing	900	clock	hours	and	26	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The combined	subsidized	and	unsubsidized	prorated	annual	loan	limit	for	the	300-hour	program	at	School	B	is	$1,815, not	more	than	$1,155	of	which	may	be	subsidized	(see	Chapter	5	of	this	volume	for	guidance	on	calculating prorated	annual	loan	limits).

For	the	abbreviated	loan	period	at	School	B	(June	15	to	July	31),	a	transfer	student	would	normally	be	eligible	to receive	the	difference	between	the	full	first-year	annual	loan	limit	and	the	loan	amount	received	at	School	A	(that is,	an	additional	$1,750	subsidized	and	$1,000	unsubsidized).	In	this	example,	however,	the	student	may	not receive	those	amounts,	because	they	would	exceed	the	prorated	annual	loan	limits	for	the	300	clock-hour program.	Therefore,	the	maximum	loan	amount	the	student	may	receive	for	the	program	at	School	B	(for	the abbreviated	loan	period	and	any	subsequent	loan	period	combined)	is	a	total	of	$1,815,	not	more	than	$1,155	of which	may	be	subsidized	(the	prorated	loan	limits	for	the	program).	If	the	student	receives	the	maximum	prorated loan	limit	for	the	program	during	the	abbreviated	loan	period,	there	is	no	remaining	loan	eligibility	for	the program	following	the	completion	of	the	abbreviated	loan	period.

## Transfers	Between	Programs	at	the	Same	School

Unless	a	student	is	considered	to	remain	in	the	same	loan	period	and	payment	period	(see	below),	when	a	student transfers	within	the	same	academic	year	from	one	program	to	a	different	program	at	the	same	school,	and	the	new program	is	a	clock-hour,	non-term,	or	non-SE9W	nonstandard	term	program,	the	school	may	originate	an	initial	loan	for the	new	program	with	an	abbreviated	loan	period	that	ends	on	the	calendar	period	ending	date	of	the	academic	year associated	with	the	prior	program.	The	same	abbreviated	loan	period	rules	that	apply	when	a	student	transfers	from	one school	to	another	school	(see	above)	also	apply	when	a	student	transfers	within	the	same	academic	year	to	a	new program	at	the	same	school.

If	certain	requirements	are	met,	when	a	student	who	has	received	a	Direct	Loan	for	one	program	transfers	to	a	different program	at	the	same	school,	you	have	the	option	of	considering	the	student	to	remain	in	the	same	payment	period	and loan	period.	Otherwise,	you	must	place	the	student	in	a	new	payment	period	and	originate	a	new	loan	with	a	new	loan period.

## Same	Payment	Period	and	Same	Loan	Period

At	your	option,	you	can	consider	a	student	who	transfers	from	one	program	to	another	program	at	the	same	school	to	be in	the	same	payment	period	and	loan	period	if	all	the	following	conditions	apply:

- The	student	is	continuously	enrolled	at	the	school;
- The	coursework	in	the	payment	period	the	student	is	transferring	out	of	is	substantially	similar	to	the	coursework	the student	will	be	taking	when	they	first	transfer	to	the	new	program;
- The	student9s	current	payment	period	and	the	payment	periods	that	would	otherwise	apply	in	the	new	program	are substantially	equal	in	length	in	weeks	of	instructional	time	and	credit	or	clock	hours;
- There	are	few	or	no	changes	in	school	charges	associated	with	the	transfer	to	the	new	program;	and
- The	credits	or	clock	hours	from	the	payment	period	the	student	is	transferring	out	of	are	accepted	toward	the	new program.

If	you	choose	to	keep	the	student	in	the	same	payment	period,	the	loan	period	for	the	loan	the	student	received	for	the first	program	would	also	remain	the	same.	However,	you	must	consider	any	changes	as	to	when	the	student	is	expected to	complete	the	hours	and	weeks	of	instructional	time	of	the	academic	year	and	make	any	necessary	adjustments	to	the ending	date	of	the	loan	period	or	the	dates	of	the	second	and	any	subsequent	disbursements.

## New	Payment	Period	and	New	Loan	Period

If	the	requirements	described	above	are	not	met,	or	if	they	are	met	but	you	choose	to	place	a	student	who	transfers	from one	program	to	a	different	program	in	a	new	payment	period,	you	must	perform	a	Return	of	Title	IV	(R2T4)	funds calculation	for	the	student9s	withdrawal	from	the	payment	period	in	the	first	program.	This	is	assuming	that	the	student did	not	complete	that	payment	period	without	starting	a	new	one	before	transferring	into	the	new	program	if	the	R2T4 calculation	is	done	on	a	payment	period	basis.	Likewise,	it	is	assuming	the	student	did	not	complete	the	loan	period	if	the calculation	is	done	on	a	period	of	enrollment	basis.	That	calculation	would	close	out	the	original	loan	period.	Then	the student	would	start	over	with	a	new	loan	period	for	their	new	program	that	uses	the	remaining	annual	loan	limit	eligibility from	the	academic	year	associated	with	the	first	program.

If	a	student	transfers	from	one	program	at	your	school	to	a	different	program	at	your	school	within	the	same	academic year	and	is	not	considered	to	remain	in	the	same	payment	period	and	loan	period	(regardless	of	whether	the	student completed	the	first	program	or	is	changing	to	a	different	program	without	having	completed	the	first	program),	you	may originate	an	initial	loan	for	the	new	program	with	an	abbreviated	loan	period	that	ends	on	the	calendar	period	ending	date of	the	academic	year	associated	with	the	prior	program,	as	described	in	more	detail	above.	As	with	a	student	who transfers	from	a	different	school,	for	the	abbreviated	loan	period,	the	student	may	receive	up	to	the	difference	between the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	for	the	new	program	and	the	loan	amount	that	the	student	received	for	the	prior	program during	the	same	academic	year.

Volume	8,	Chapter	7,	Example	4:	Transfer	Into	a	Non-Term	Credit-Hour	Program	at	the	Same	School

A	school	offers	some	programs	in	a	standard	term	academic	calendar	and	other	programs	in	a	non-term	calendar. A	first-year	dependent	undergraduate	student	enrolls	in	a	standard	term	program	with	an	SAY	consisting	of	fall, winter,	and	spring	quarters	and	receives	the	first	and	second	disbursements	of	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	(total	of $2,234)	and	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	(total	of	$1,334).	The	loan	period	and	academic	year	dates	are September	1	to	May	31.

The	student	decides	not	to	finish	the	program	and	after	completing	the	winter	quarter	transfers	to	a	2-year	nonterm	credit	hour	program	offered	at	the	same	school.	The	academic	year	for	the	new	program	is	defined	as	24 semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time.	The	student	begins	the	new	program	on	March	1.	For	the	new program,	the	school	may	originate	an	initial	loan	for	an	abbreviated	loan	period	that	begins	on	March	1	and	ends on	May	31,	the	ending	date	of	the	academic	year	associated	with	the	loans	the	student	received	for	the	first program.	For	the	abbreviated	loan	period,	the	student	can	receive	up	to	$1,932,	not	more	than	$1,266	of	which may	be	subsidized.	This	represents	the	difference	between	the	first-year	dependent	undergraduate	annual	loan limit	($5,500,	maximum	$3,500	subsidized)	and	the	loan	amounts	received	for	the	first	program	during	the overlapping	academic	year.

On	June	1,	the	first	BBAY	3	for	the	new	program	will	begin.	(BBAY	3	must	be	used	because	this	is	a	non-term credit-hour	program.)	The	loan	period	will	be	for	the	first	full	academic	year	of	the	new	program	(the	period during	which	the	student	will	be	expected	to	complete	24	semester	hours	and	30	weeks	of	instructional	time).
