## Texas Scholarships And Grants

## Get an Advantage Over Your Education Costs

Texas wants all of its high school graduates to have the opportunity to realize their post-secondary education goals. Through the College for All Texans (http://www.collegefortexans.com/) initiative, college-bound students in the Lone Star state have access to a wide array of information on colleges, universities and vocational schools within the state. More importantly, the state sponsored website provides much needed information on available scholarships, grants, loans and loan repayment programs dedicated to helping Texans achieve their dream of a college education.

Students in Texas who wish to take advantage of the many financial aid programs sponsored by the state, must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). After the successful completion of the FAFSA, students may then begin their search for the scholarships, grants and loan programs for which they may be eligible.
