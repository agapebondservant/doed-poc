## Getting College Financial Aid As A Student In Delaware

## Make Your Hard Work Pay Off

Delaware's state legislature understands the importance of encouraging its residents to pursue a college education. The state's governing body recognizes that a well educated populace is one of the keys to a vibrant and healthy local economy.

In an effort to make college more accessible to its residents and to reward the hard working students within its borders, Delaware offers a wide range of grants and scholarships designed to make a college education more affordable. These programs are a combination of need-based and meritbased awards, and are administered through Delaware's Higher Education Office (http://www.doe.k12.de.us/infosuites/students\_family/dheo/default.shtml).

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any state-based financial aid, resident students in the great state of Delaware must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The information students supply on their FAFSA is used to determine their eligibility for any Federal or state sponsored financial aid for college. The FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities, as well as the majority of independent scholarship sponsors, in determining a students eligibility for an award, and in setting the final award amounts. Resident students of the First State should make the FAFSA a top priority in their search for college funding.

## General Scholarships and Grants

The state of Delaware offers a full range of general scholarships and grants for its resident college-bound students. These programs are a mix of merit-based and need-based awards, and are designed to help state residents cover tuition costs at participating state colleges and universities. A variety of general

The state of Delaware currently offers the following career specific financial aid programs:
