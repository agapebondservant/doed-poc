## Scholarships, Grants, And Other Awards In Maryland

## State Government Programs

The government of the state of Maryland is determined to make higher education more accessible to its resident students. Through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (http://www.mhec.state.md.us/), state residents can find a wide array of grants, scholarships and tuition waivers designed to make college more affordable. These state supported programs are a mixture of need-based, merit-based and career specific financial aid. For collegebound students in the state of Maryland, struggling to pay for their college education, financial aid opportunities abound.

## The FAFSA and Government Financial Aid

All Federal and state supported financial aid for college students requires the submission of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The information supplied by the student on their FAFSA is used to prepare a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which outlines the level of financial aid for which the applicant has qualified. The submission of the FAFSA should be made a priority, and should be completed before beginning the search for any college financial aid.
