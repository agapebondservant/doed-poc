## Scholarships And Grants In Montana

## Options for Residents and Non-Residents

To stay on pace with federal efforts, and provide supplementary assistance, states offer their own brands of financial aid for college students.  When federal resources, from the Pell Grant (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm)program and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/direct.htm) run dry, Montana students of higher education use state-specific funding (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/state.htm) to meet tuition obligations.

Whether you are a resident or non-resident, there are a number of state programs available to underwrite Montana higher education costs. The Office of Public Instruction (http://opi.mt.gov/)provides a limited number of programs, and the Montana State University System (http://mus.edu/)supports its academic programs with a number of scholarships and grants.  Awards are issued by public and private agencies, including need-based and merit-based options for qualified applicants.  Candidates also participate in student-specific financial aid (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm) initiatives designed to benefit particular groups, like Montana's Native American population.

## Montana State Government Scholarship and Grant Programs

The Montana Governor's Post-secondary Scholarship is a need and merit-based incentive. The Best and Brightest Program (http://mus.edu/Prepare/Pay/Scholarships/Governors\_Best\_and\_Brightest\_Scholarship.asp) is designed to make college education more accessible to Montana residents, and to keep greater numbers of state graduates living and working within their home state. Eligible candidates maintain a GPA of 2.5, and submit timely FAFSA applications. Awards are valued in the range of $1000 - $2000 each.

## The federally-funded Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program

(http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) selects honors-level high school seniors, and provides financial assistance for stand-out academics throughout the state. Selected  students are already accepted into four-year college programs, maintaining high academic standards.

The U.S. Senate Youth Program (http://www.hearstfdn.org/ussyp/) promotes the activities of students immersed in campus-government organizations. Funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, this scholarship program chooses two students annually, from more than 100 'student delegates,' to receive $5000 scholarships. Applicants are required to complete rigorous examinations,  and participate in oral interviews.
