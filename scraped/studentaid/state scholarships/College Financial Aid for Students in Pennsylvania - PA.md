## Pennsylvania Scholarships And Grants

## Tired of High Tuition Costs?

Resident students in the state of Pennsylvania have access to a wide variety of financial aid programs designed to help them achieve their post-secondary educational goals. These programs consist of scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs that are supported by the state government, and administered through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (http://www.pheaa.org/). Since 1963 the PHEAA has been helping college-bound students in Pennsylvania find the money they need to pay for college. Today the PHEAA continues to offer valuable financial advice and assistance to resident college-bound students of the Keystone State.

## The FAFSA

The first step on the path to financial aid is to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required for all Federal and state sponsored financial aid. It is also used to determine eligibility for most privately funded and school sponsored grants and scholarships. After submitting the FAFSA, students will receive their personalized Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/nextsteps/student-aid-report), which will outline the levels of financial assistance for which they have qualified. Students should make the FAFSA a priority before applying to any Federal, state or independent financial aid programs.

## General Grants and Scholarships

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania supports a variety of grants and scholarships designed to help students in the Keystone State meet the costs of their higher education. The majority of these programs target the needs of students engaged in general studies, and can be applied at any in-state college or university. As with all state sponsored financial aid, programs are subject to change according to the availability of funding.

The following general financial aid programs are available to Pennsylvania's resident college-bound students.

- The Pennsylvania State Grant Program (http://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/state-grantprogram/index.shtml)  is  available  to  undergraduate  students  enrolled  in  a  participating  in-state,  or  out-ofstate, college or university. Applicants must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need, and must be enrolled  at  least  half-time  in  an  approved  course  of  study.  Award  amounts  vary,  and  are  determined  by financial need, cost of tuition, and availability of funds.
- The Pennsylvania House of Representatives Scholarship Program (http://www.tfec.org/images/House%20of%20Reps%201%20Page%20Summary.pdf)  is  a  privately  funded annual  scholarship  administered  by  the  Pennsylvania  General  Assembly.  Two  full  tuition  scholarships  are awarded every year to eligible students enrolled full-time at a state college, university, or trade school.

## Loan Forgiveness Programs for Pennsylvania Students

In addition to the grants and scholarships administered through the PHEAA, Pennsylvania offers two loan forgiveness programs for students who are pursuing careers in certain high demand professions. These programs are designed to repay part, or all, of a graduate's outstanding student debt if they fulfill certain work-related requirements. These are, in essence, award-for-service programs.

- The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (http://www.myfedloan.org/manage-account/loan-forgivenessdischarge-programs/public-service-loan-forgiveness.shtml?tab=2&amp;src=PHEAA)  is  available  to  graduates  who have received Federal Direct Loans, and who are working within the state in a public service capacity. Eligible

service includes careers in child protection and family services, law enforcement, early childhood education, public health, and public services for individuals with disabilities.

- The Federal Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program (http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgivenesscancellation/charts/teacher)  is  offered  to  graduates  with  outstanding  Direct  Loans  who  are  working  as teachers  at  a  designated  critical  shortage  facility,  or  in  low-income  communities  within  the  state  of Pennsylvania. Graduates who have been approved for the program may be eligible for up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness.

## Independently Funded State Specific Financial Aid

Beyond the state supported programs already discussed, students in Pennsylvania also have access to a wide range of independently funded grants and scholarships designed to increase the public's access to higher education.
