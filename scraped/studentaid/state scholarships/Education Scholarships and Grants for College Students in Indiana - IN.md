## Are You A Resident Of Or Studying In Indiana?

## Scholarship and Grant Programs

The state government of Indiana recognizes the value of continued education, and works hard to encourage and support its residents in their pursuit of a college degree. Through the state's Division of Student Financial Aid (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/index.htm), Indiana administers a variety of scholarships and grants designed to help resident students meet the ever rising costs of a college education. These financial aid programs take many forms. Some are general grants and scholarships that provide much needed funds to students regardless of their major or ultimate career goal. Others are subject specific, and have been developed to encourage students to pursue careers in certain high need professions such as teaching and healthcare. Whether decided on the basis of academic merit or financial need, these financial aid programs share one common goal - to make college more accessible to the residents of the Hoosier State.

## The Importance of the FAFSA

The first step in applying for any state-based financial aid for college is the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is a requirement for all students applying for any Federal or state-based scholarships, grants or loans. The information students provide on their FAFSA application is used to determine their eligibility for any and all government financial assistance. The FAFSA is also used by most colleges, universities, and independent financial aid advisory boards to determine a student's eligibility for any available grants or scholarships.

Indiana residents who are interested in applying for any state-based grants, scholarships or loan forgiveness programs should make the submission of their FAFSA a top priority.

## General Scholarships and Grant Programs

The state of Indiana offers a variety of general grants and scholarships for its resident students. These programs are applicable to all college-bound residents of Indiana who are enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in a state college or university. As with all state supported financial aid for college  students, programs are subject to change without notice according to availability of funds.

The following general scholarships and grants are currently being sponsored by the state of Indiana.

- The  Mitch  Daniels  Early  Graduation  Scholarship  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2504.htm)  is  offered  to  students who graduate at least one year early from a public high school within the state of Indiana. The scholarship is valued at $4000, and can be used at any participating Indiana college or university. This is a one time award, and can not be renewed. Students who opt to take the GED prior to graduation are not eligible.
- The  Frank  O'Bannon  Grant  Program  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2346.htm),  formerly  known  as  the  Indiana Higher Education Grant, is a need-based award for high school graduates, or GED holders, who are enrolled in an undergraduate program at a state college or university.

The  Part-Time  Grant  Award  is  term based, and is renewable for each semester. The minimum award is $50 per term.

## Career Specific Financial Aid

Like many states across the country, Indiana is suffering from a critical shortage of qualified teachers and nurses. As a way to address the shortfall, the state has implemented two scholarship programs designed to encourage and support students who choose to pursue careers in these high need fields.

The following career specific scholarships are currently being offered by the state of Indiana for its resident students.

- The  Indiana  Nursing  Scholarship  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2343.htm)  was  created  in  1990  to  encourage students to pursue degrees and careers in nursing. To be eligible, students must be accepted to an approved nursing  program  at  a  state  institute  of  higher  education,  must  have  a  minimum  GPA  of  2.0,  and  must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. This is an award-for-service scholarship, and recipients must agree to work at a critical need healthcare facility within the state for a minimum of 2 years. The maximum annual  award  is  $5000,  and  the  scholarship  is  renewable  for  as  long  as  the  student  meets  the  eligibility requirements.
- The Minority Teacher/Special Services Scholarship (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2342.htm) was created in 1988 to address the critical shortage of African-American and Hispanic-American teachers within the state of Indiana. Eligible applicants must be pursuing a teaching certificate at a state college or university. While non-minority students may apply, preference is given to students of African-American and Hispanic-American descent. The maximum annual award is $4000 for minority students, and $1000 for non-minority students. The scholarship is renewable for as long as the student can meet the program requirements.

The Indiana Commission for Higher Education (http://www.in.gov/che/) is determined to make a college education more accessible to students in the Hoosier State. Through the Division of Student Financial Aid (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/index.htm), the CHE administers a wide variety of valuable grants and scholarships designed to make college more affordable for the resident students of Indiana.
