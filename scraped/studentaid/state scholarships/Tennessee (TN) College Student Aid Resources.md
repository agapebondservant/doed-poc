## Scholarships And Grants In Tennessee

## See if You Fit the Requirements

Most states offer some level of financial assistance for their college-bound residents. Scholarships and grants are routinely sponsored by state governments, and financed with state revenues. Like many of its sister states, Tennessee has a state lottery which it uses to fund a variety of post-secondary financial aid programs for its resident students. State proceeds from this lottery are used to finance the wide range of scholarships, grants and loan-forgiveness programs administered by the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (http://www.tn.gov/collegepays/). Since their inception, these state sponsored financial aid programs have made a college education more accessible to thousands of students in the Volunteer State.

## The FAFSA

All Federal and state sponsored financial aid for college-bound students begins with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). Every college-bound student pursuing government funded scholarships, grants or loan-forgiveness programs must first fill out and submit the FAFSA. The information students supply on their FAFSA application is used to determine the level of financial assistance for which they are eligible. All students preparing for college should make the FAFSA application their first priority.
