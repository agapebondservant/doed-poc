## New York Scholarships

## Key takeaways:

- Local organizations and community foundations offer scholarships to students from specific regions or communities within New York, often with less competition compared to state or national awards.
- The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) is one of the most well-known state-funded programs providing significant financial support to eligible New York residents attending in-state colleges.
- Scholarships for New York students can cover a significant portion of tuition and other educational expenses.

Most people know that living in New York, especially New York City, is expensive compared to most of the rest of the country. And few people know that better than college students. That's where New York scholarships can help. These scholarships are given to students who are either from the Empire State or who are going to school there. They can be used to cover tuition, room and board, textbooks, fees and other expenses.

## What is a New York Scholarship?

A New York scholarship refers to a scholarship that is given to a college student who is either from New York or who attends school in New York. New York scholarships and grants don't have to be paid back after graduation, so they're the best way to fund your education.

Scholarships don't just fall into your lap; you have to actively search and apply for them. One of the best ways to find scholarships is to look for ones that are particular to your interests, skills and other attributes. Geographic-based scholarships, like New York scholarships, are a perfect example of one way to narrow your search and find the most attractive scholarships.

## Where to find New York Scholarships

If you're already enrolled in college, your financial aid department should have information about different scholarships you can apply for. Also, your department's academic advisor may also have ideas on how to find scholarships for your specific major. You can also ask professors, supervisors and other adults you know about potential scholarships.

The New York State Department of Education is also a good starting spot for scholarships. Just be aware that you should also take the time to do your own research. Start by writing down a list of everything about you, from where you live to what you want to study. Then, do a Google search for those adjectives plus the word 'scholarship.'

For example, if you're part of the marching band and/or play an instrument, look up 'music scholarships.' You can even get more granular and look up 'New York music scholarships.'

Rinse and repeat this process for all the words on your list. If you're having trouble brainstorming, talk to a parent, teacher or coach to see if they can help you come up with a list.

## How to apply for New York scholarships

Applying for a New York scholarship is similar to applying for any other kind of award. As always, you should make sure you understand the eligibility rules and requirements. Geographic scholarships often have specific residency requirements.

For example, you may have to have been a New York resident for a certain period of time to be eligible. These types of scholarships may also require that you attend school in New York.

Once you determine that you are eligible, read through the required documents. Many New York scholarships require at least one essay and a letter of recommendation. Applying for a scholarship can take time because you have to gather all of the necessary documents, write your essay and wait for someone to write a letter of recommendation.

Try to give yourself plenty of time to complete the application and start as early as possible. The more time you give yourself, the less likely it is that you'll make a mistake that could get you disqualified.

Many scholarships require that students submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is the overarching form that gives students access to federal financial aid, such as federal student loans, grants and work-study.

What most students don't know is that many scholarships also use the FAFSA to determine eligibility. This is most common with need-based scholarships, but also comes up with

merit-based awards. Even if you don't think you'll qualify for need-based aid, you should always fill out the FAFSA.

Some even require that students submit the CSS Profile, which is another kind of college financial aid form. Many scholarships will have their own form with other questions.
