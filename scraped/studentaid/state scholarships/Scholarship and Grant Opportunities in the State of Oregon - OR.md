## Scholarships And Grants In Oregon

## Couldn't We All Use Some Extra Cash?

Nearly every college-bound student will need to secure some level of financial aid to help them cover the costs of their post-secondary education. To answer the financial needs of their resident students, most states sponsor a variety of grants and scholarships designed to make a college education more accessible, and more affordable. Oregon is no exception, and currently offers a variety of scholarships and state-funded grants, for its resident students who are struggling to meet the rising costs of a college education.

Oregon's student aid programs are administered through the Oregon Student Assistance Commission (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/home.aspx), as well as through the financial aid offices of state supported colleges and universities. These programs are a mix of need-based and merit-based awards, and they provide valuable financial assistance to the resident students of the Beaver State.

## Submitting the FAFSA

The first step in any college-bound student's search for financial aid should be the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used by Federal and state agencies to determine the levels of financial aid for which a given student is eligible. Once students have submitted their FAFSA, they will be issued with a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aidreport) which will outline the full extent of the financial assistance for which they have qualified.

Students should make the FAFSA a priority in their search for college funding. In addition to being a requirement for all state and Federal student aid, the FAFSA is also used by most colleges, private associations, and lending institutions to determine an applicant's eligibility for financial aid.

## Education Grants for Oregon Students

The state of Oregon sponsors a variety of education grants for its resident students. Eligibility requirements vary greatly among these programs, as do the monetary awards. As with all state-funded financial aid programs, funding is subject to change according to economic conditions within the state.
