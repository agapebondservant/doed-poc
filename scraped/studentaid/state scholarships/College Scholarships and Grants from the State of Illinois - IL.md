## Illinois Scholarships And Grants

## Save Your College Money

The government of the State of Illinois is dedicated to making college more accessible, and affordable, to its resident students. Through the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, and their dedicated website College Zone (http://www.collegezone.com/index.htm), resident students of the Land of Lincoln can find vital information on scholarships, grants and loan repayment programs designed to help them reach their educational goals.

The programs supported by the state of Illinois target students from all backgrounds. Residents will find grants based on financial need, scholarships based on academic achievement and financial aid programs designed to encourage and support students with specific professional ambitions. For resident students of the great state of Illinois, school is in session.

## First Stop - The FAFSA

Students who wish to apply for any federal or state supported financial aid must first fill out and submit the Free

Application For Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA will determine the level of financial aid for which students are eligible. All government funded student aid is awarded according to the information supplied via the FAFSA, and no student will be considered for funding until it has been submitted, and a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report) has been issued.

## General Scholarships and Grants

General scholarships and grants at the state level can be either meritbased, or need-based. Most states offer a combination of both, and students applying for state aid will be required to provide proof of their own income, their family's income and their school transcripts. Much of this information will be included in the student's FAFSA application, though applicants should be prepared to provide any extra information that may be required by their state.
