## The State Of Nevada's College Aid

## Scholarships and Grants to Help You Acquire a

Degree

Nevada provides educational opportunities at a range of state colleges, universities and community colleges. Schools like College of Southern Nevada (http://www.csn.edu/),  Great Basin College, and Truckee Meadows Community College (http://www.tmcc.edu/) may not have household names, but wide-ranging degree pursuits are satisfied at these, and other Nevada institutions of higher education.

To support the efforts of needy state students, financial aid originates from a variety of public and private sector sources.  In addition to large-scale federal government assistance programs, Nevada students rely on statespecific resources (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm) to meet college expenses.  To uncover Nevada's financial aid riches, explore the Nevada State Treasurer's Office, the Nevada System of Higher Education (http://system.nevada.edu/Nshe/) and the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education.

## General Scholarships and Grants

One of the most popular Nevada scholarships is the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship

(https://nevadatreasurer.gov/millenniumscholarship.htm). This scholarship program is administered through the Nevada State Treasurer's Office, and made possible by the cooperative 1999 efforts of several State Government agencies, including the Nevada System of  Higher Education Board of Regents.  High school seniors with exceptional academic standing are encouraged to apply. Eligible candidates are entering approved four-year degree programs and are prepared to declare their academic majors. In many cases, the scholarship covers a large portion of each successful participant's total tuition costs. This program was developed to challenge Nevada students, and give them incentives to pursue competitive high school curricula that prepare them for the academic rigors of higher education.

Institutions that are eligible for Kenny C. Guinn Memorial Millennium Scholarships include these schools:

## The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education

(http://www.wiche.edu/) administers the Western Undergraduate Exchange Program, which accommodates educational flexibility for students who might otherwise be discouraged by the cost of non-

resident tuition at schools outside their native states. Generally, Nevada college students enrolling in other participating western states qualify for tuition reduction that lowers their total fees to rates only 50% higher than those enjoyed by residents of those states.

## Nevada State College System Grants and Scholarships

State-funded college systems, like Nevada's, administer state-backed financial aid programs that benefit students enrolled at state schools. A handful of college assistance programs are in-place to offset college expenses within the Nevada system.

The Nevada State Access Grant (http://nsc.nevada.edu/1412.asp)is a general award, disbursed to the neediest state applicants.  Because funding for the program is limited, early applicants maintain the greatest likelihood of landing grants.

Out-of-State Grant-in-Aid provides financial assistance for out of state students attending Nevada schools.  To qualify, submit the NSC Scholarship application and the Grant-in-Aid application.

- * Important notice:  The Regents Award Program is now known as the Regents Service Program. The initiative offers disadvantaged students the opportunity to work in community service jobs while still attending school. Requirements that qualify candidates include:  single parent household, age 22 or older, financially disadvantaged, and a lack of social, cultural or familial support, combined with a history of educational displacement.  Priority consideration for Nevada Regents Service Program (http://www.unlv.edu/finaid/workprograms/regents-service) is given to candidates who file FAFSA by February 1st.

## Specialized Scholarships and Grants

Like many other Western states, Nevada contains large rural regions that are typically considered medically under-served by many health-care professions. As a result, Nevada's Professional Student Exchange Program (http://wiche.edu/sep/psep/) offers incentives for students seeking education and training that is not available in Nevada. Eleven Western states participate in the program, which provides several advantages for enrolled students.  Program participants are given priority admissions consideration at some schools, and receive reduced tuition for studying certain fields.  For approved academic programs, tuition rates are drawn down to in-state levels for student exchange participants.  Some health care fields currently eligible for funding:

- Podiatry
- Occupational therapy
- Optometry
- Veterinary medicine
- Dentistry
- Physical therapy
- Others

Nevada's Health Care Access Program (http://www.health.nv.gov/NHAP.htm) takes steps to address shortages of health care professionals within the state's medically under-served territories and facilities. Grants are available for nursing students, physician assistants and physical therapists. Loan repayment programs are available for working nurses, dentists and mental health professionals. Successful applicants agree to work for no less than 2 years in designated Nevada health care facilities.

Additional nursing scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm), loan forgiveness and other financial opportunities for medical education (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/healthscience.htm) exist across the United States.
