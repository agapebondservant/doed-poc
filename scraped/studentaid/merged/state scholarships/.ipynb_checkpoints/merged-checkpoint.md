## Academic Funding From The State Of South Carolina

## Do You Have Enough Money to Earn a Degree?

With more than sixty colleges and universities positioned within the state, South Carolina is a prominent resource for students of higher education.  Clemson (http://www.clemson.edu/), University of South Carolina, College of Charleston, The Citadel (http://www.citadel.edu/root/)and other notable state schools educate tens of thousands of students annually.  Within the state, private benefactors and public agencies work to provide needed financial aid for university and community college students.

For individuals studying in South Carolina, the best approach to college funding is to utilize all available financial aid resources including government-sponsored college assistance, campus-specific scholarships and educational funding that originates from the private sector.  The South Carolina Department of Education (http://www.ed.sc.gov/) administers scholarships and grants for students who prove financial need and/or academic merit.  The South Carolina Commission on Higher Education (http://www.che.sc.gov/) oversees state colleges and universities, and often partners with the South Carolina Higher Education Foundation (http://www.schighered-foundation.org/) to promote education within the state, and to develop effective programs for South Carolina institutions of higher education.

Merit-based scholarships and need-based grants provide gift-aid that does not require repayment, and South Carolina resources also include low interest student loan opportunities.

## General Scholarships and Grants

The South Carolina HOPE Scholarship (http://www.che.sc.gov/New\_Web/GoingToCollege/HOPE\_Hm.htm) is a merit-based program that provides tuition awards to academically talented students who are not receiving other state-sponsored merit scholarships. A summary of the program recognizes the role it plays in South Carolina education.  HOPE awards are:

- Earmarked for freshman students
- Merit-based
- For students at four-year universities
- Not for students that qualify for other programs like LIFE and Palmetto Fellows Scholarships.
- For in-state attendance
- Funded by the South Carolina Education Lottery

The Legislative Incentive for Future Excellence (http://www.che.sc.gov/New\_Web/GoingToCollege/LIFE\_Hm.htm) (LIFE) Scholarship provides tuition awards to academically motivated students. The program was established to assist high achievers, and to induce them to pursue higher education within the state.  Talented students stay home for college when government incentives support in-state education. LIFE Awards carry these conditions:

- Merit-based
- Administered by individual campus financial aid offices
- Are applied to tuition at public or independent institutions of higher education
- Apply to in-state education
- Are renewable for up to eight academic semesters; provided eligibility requirements are maintained
- Partially funded by the state lottery.

The South Carolina Education Lottery provides funding for the SC Lottery Tuition Assistance Program (http://www.che.sc.gov/New\_Web/GoingToCollege/LTA\_Hm.htm). The initiative specifically serves as a supplemental resource for qualified applicants attending two-year institutions within the state. The program was established in 2001, and current full-time participants are eligible for awards of $936 for each academic term. Awards are subject to change, based on lottery proceeds.

The Palmetto Fellows Scholarship (http://www.che.sc.gov/New\_Web/GoingToCollege/PF\_Hm.htm) was established to encouraging academically talented students to study at colleges and universities within South Carolina. The merit-based scholarships are highly competitive, and serve the cream of the academic crop. Freshmen are eligible for up to $6700 annually, which is disbursed in two installments - one each semester. Sophomores, juniors and seniors qualify for $7500 each year.  In 2007, the program was enhanced to expand benefits for certain student groups.

## The federally funded Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program

(http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) recognizes the efforts of academically talented high school seniors. This merit-based program provides dozens of annual scholarships to students from South Carolina. Participants are eligible to renew for up to 3 years of subsequent undergraduate study. Eligible participants hold GPAs above 3.5, and score highly on ACT/SAT entrance exams.  Leadership qualities are considered as part of the evaluation process for these scholarships. School officials typically nominate Byrd Scholars, and only those students who are already accepted into full-time four-year college and university programs are considered.

The South Carolina Tuition Grants Program (http://www.sctuitiongrants.com/) is a need-based fund that underwrites higher education for the state's neediest college applicants.  Participating public and private colleges administer gift-aid that does not require repayment.  Increasing access for disadvantaged students, and promoting diversity within the student body are the fund's primary objectives. Application starts with a timelyfiled FAFSA that allows campus financial aid administrators to assess each applicant's need for these grants from the State Higher Education Commission.

## Specialized Studies Programs

Like other areas of the country, South Carolina needs more qualified educators to meet growing demands. Pursuing a teaching degree in South Carolina opens doors to state aid programs intended to encourage student teachers.  The South Carolina Teacher Loan Program (http://ed.sc.gov/agency/lpa/publicaffairs/SCTeacherLoanProgram.cfm) provides low-interest loans to South Carolina students pursuing teacher

certification.  In exchange, students who agree to work in high-need schools qualify for loan forgiveness. The program mirrors federal efforts to stimulate greater enrollment in teacher education programs.  Additional financial aid resources for teachers (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm) provide supplemental assistance for students who need it.

Unique to South Carolina is the Archibald Rutledge Scholarship (http://ed.sc.gov/agency/programsservices/62/ArchibaldRutledgeScholarshipProgram.cfm), which provides merit-based funding for artistic high school seniors within the state.  Applicants compete in areas like visual arts, music, writing and other creative forms of expression. $5000 scholarships help winners fund advanced educational pursuits in the arts.

More than 200 high school students with teaching aptitude qualify for the South Carolina Teaching Fellows Program (http://ed.sc.gov/agency/lpa/public-affairs/SCTeachingFellowsProgram.cfm) each year. Candidates attend state colleges and universities with teacher education programs, and agree to work as teachers in under-served South Carolina schools following graduation.

## Campus Aid From South Carolina Colleges and Universities

Clemson University supports financial assistance programs (http://www.clemson.edu/financial-aid/) for approximately 87% of the students attending the school.  Aid packages blend state, federal and university resources to meet funding needs for qualified Clemson students.  Tuition assistance is disbursed in various forms, including:

- Merit Scholarships
- Need-based Grants
- Student Loans
- Work Study

One unique Clemson initiative recruits incoming freshman to receive financial assistance from campus-based aid programs (http://www.clemson.edu/financial-aid/documents/RecruitSchol1314.pdf) like Trustees Scholarships, Clemson Scholars awards and Palmetto Pact Scholarships.  High achievers and needy enrollees receive awards valued from one to three thousand dollars each.

Military-minded degree candidates enjoy access to scholarships at The Citadel (http://www.citadel.edu/root/finaid).  Competition for financial aid at The Citadel is highly competitive, but like other schools, the university uses FAFSA results to determine eligibility for campus-specific financial aid. Wherever you apply, it is imperative that you file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA) on-time.  Not only does the federal application open doo0rs to mainstream government-sponsored assistance like Pell Grants and Federal Direct Loans (http://www.direct.ed.gov/), but it also provides a reference for campus financial aid offices that administer university programs.

Columbia University (http://www.columbiasc.edu/admissions/financial-aid) financial aid includes scholarships and grant programs benefiting 85% of students attending the school.  Financial aid initiatives for women at the college meet funding needs flexibly, by offering these options:

- First-Year Scholarships
- Transfer Scholarships
- Transfer Grants
- Loans
- Grants
- Student Employment
- Flexible Tuition Payment Plans

McNair, Founders, Presidential and Trustee scholarships each recognize outstanding academic achievement and high college entrance exam scores.  Other program-specific Columbia Scholarships are issued to individual students for exceptional performance in curricular areas like art, music and athletics.

## Illinois Scholarships And Grants

## Save Your College Money

The government of the State of Illinois is dedicated to making college more accessible, and affordable, to its resident students. Through the Illinois Student Assistance Commission, and their dedicated website College Zone (http://www.collegezone.com/index.htm), resident students of the Land of Lincoln can find vital information on scholarships, grants and loan repayment programs designed to help them reach their educational goals.

The programs supported by the state of Illinois target students from all backgrounds. Residents will find grants based on financial need, scholarships based on academic achievement and financial aid programs designed to encourage and support students with specific professional ambitions. For resident students of the great state of Illinois, school is in session.

## First Stop - The FAFSA

Students who wish to apply for any federal or state supported financial aid must first fill out and submit the Free

Application For Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA will determine the level of financial aid for which students are eligible. All government funded student aid is awarded according to the information supplied via the FAFSA, and no student will be considered for funding until it has been submitted, and a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report) has been issued.

## General Scholarships and Grants

General scholarships and grants at the state level can be either meritbased, or need-based. Most states offer a combination of both, and students applying for state aid will be required to provide proof of their own income, their family's income and their school transcripts. Much of this information will be included in the student's FAFSA application, though applicants should be prepared to provide any extra information that may be required by their state.

<!-- image -->

Active scholarship and grant programs are subject to changes in legislation, as well as fluctuations in the state economy. Students should keep up to date with information provided by the Illinois Student Assistance Commission regarding any changes in the state's financial aid services.

The Following general grants and scholarships will give resident students in the Prairie State an idea of the programs currently supported by their state government.

- The Illinois General Assembly Legislative Scholarship (http://www.isbe.net/gov\_relations/html/scholarships.htm) is designed to provide financial support to resident students attending one of Illinois' state supported universities. Each member of the state's general assembly may nominate two college-bound students for consideration. Nominees are eligible to receive a 2 or 4 year scholarship. Determination is based primarily on academic achievement, though financial need will be be a component of the final decision.
- The College Savings Bond Bonus Incentive Grant (http://www.collegezone.com/416\_953.htm) is available to those students who are the beneficiary of an Illinois College Savings Bond. The grant program provides $40 to $440 in award money per every $5000 savings bond.
- The  Illinois  Monetary  Award  Program  (http://www.collegezone.com/416\_891.htm)  (MAP)  provides  grant money to residents of Illinois who are attending a cooperating state college or university. Grant amounts are determined by financial need, and the number of credit hours undertaken by the applicant.
- The Silas Purnell Illinois Incentive for Access Program (http://www.collegezone.com/416\_960.htm) provides $500  education  grants  to  resident  students  who  can  demonstrate  the  requisite  level  of  financial  need. Applicants must be currently enrolled at an accredited state college, university or technical school.
- The Illinois Dollars for Scholars Program (http://www.collegezone.com/416\_8379.htm) specializes in partnering wealthy donors with deserving college students. The goal of the program is to offer Illinois' resident students auxiliary scholarship options at a local level.

## Career Specific Grants and Scholarships

Illinois, like most states, has put into place financial aid programs to help encourage and support students who are pursuing degrees and careers in critical need professions. The United States is currently experiencing a lack of qualified nurses, teachers and public service workers, and Illinois is not exempt from the shortage.

## Pennsylvania Scholarships And Grants

## Tired of High Tuition Costs?

Resident students in the state of Pennsylvania have access to a wide variety of financial aid programs designed to help them achieve their post-secondary educational goals. These programs consist of scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs that are supported by the state government, and administered through the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (http://www.pheaa.org/). Since 1963 the PHEAA has been helping college-bound students in Pennsylvania find the money they need to pay for college. Today the PHEAA continues to offer valuable financial advice and assistance to resident college-bound students of the Keystone State.

## The FAFSA

The first step on the path to financial aid is to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required for all Federal and state sponsored financial aid. It is also used to determine eligibility for most privately funded and school sponsored grants and scholarships. After submitting the FAFSA, students will receive their personalized Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/nextsteps/student-aid-report), which will outline the levels of financial assistance for which they have qualified. Students should make the FAFSA a priority before applying to any Federal, state or independent financial aid programs.

## General Grants and Scholarships

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania supports a variety of grants and scholarships designed to help students in the Keystone State meet the costs of their higher education. The majority of these programs target the needs of students engaged in general studies, and can be applied at any in-state college or university. As with all state sponsored financial aid, programs are subject to change according to the availability of funding.

The following general financial aid programs are available to Pennsylvania's resident college-bound students.

- The Pennsylvania State Grant Program (http://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/state-grantprogram/index.shtml)  is  available  to  undergraduate  students  enrolled  in  a  participating  in-state,  or  out-ofstate, college or university. Applicants must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need, and must be enrolled  at  least  half-time  in  an  approved  course  of  study.  Award  amounts  vary,  and  are  determined  by financial need, cost of tuition, and availability of funds.
- The Pennsylvania House of Representatives Scholarship Program (http://www.tfec.org/images/House%20of%20Reps%201%20Page%20Summary.pdf)  is  a  privately  funded annual  scholarship  administered  by  the  Pennsylvania  General  Assembly.  Two  full  tuition  scholarships  are awarded every year to eligible students enrolled full-time at a state college, university, or trade school. In order to qualify students must have a minimum high school GPA of 3.0, must demonstrate a commitment to the  community  through  extracurricular  activities,  and  must  meet  the  requisite  level  of  financial  need. Application must be made by mail, and students must provide three letters of recommendation.
- The Blind or Deaf Beneficiary Grant Program (http://www.pheaa.org/funding-opportunities/other-educationalaid/blind-deaf.shtml) is designed to provide financial assistance to visually and/or hearing impaired students to help them pay for college. Applicants must be enrolled at least half-time in a state college or university, and must be able to provide documentation from a physician detailing their level of impairment. The maximum annual award is $500.

Eligible  students  must  be  enrolled  at  an  approved  state  college  or  university,  and  must  demonstrate  the required level of financial need. The maximum award amount is $2500 per academic year.

Applicants must be the child of a police office, firefighter, rescue or ambulance squad member who  died  as  a  result  of  performing  his  or  her  duties.

## Loan Forgiveness Programs for Pennsylvania Students

In addition to the grants and scholarships administered through the PHEAA, Pennsylvania offers two loan forgiveness programs for students who are pursuing careers in certain high demand professions. These programs are designed to repay part, or all, of a graduate's outstanding student debt if they fulfill certain work-related requirements. These are, in essence, award-for-service programs.

- The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (http://www.myfedloan.org/manage-account/loan-forgivenessdischarge-programs/public-service-loan-forgiveness.shtml?tab=2&amp;src=PHEAA)  is  available  to  graduates  who have received Federal Direct Loans, and who are working within the state in a public service capacity. Eligible

service includes careers in child protection and family services, law enforcement, early childhood education, public health, and public services for individuals with disabilities.

Graduates who have been approved for the program may be eligible for up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness.

## Independently Funded State Specific Financial Aid

Beyond the state supported programs already discussed, students in Pennsylvania also have access to a wide range of independently funded grants and scholarships designed to increase the public's access to higher education.

## Receive College Money As A Student In Hawaii

## Wipe Out Your Student Debt

Students in Hawaii may be surrounded by white sand beaches and the crystal blue waters of the pacific ocean, but when it comes time to plan for college they face the same financial hurdles as their mainland brothers and sisters. For many Hawaiian students, the rising cost of tuition makes pursuing a college education prohibitive.

Fortunately, there are a wide range of scholarship opportunities dedicated to the financial needs of college-bound Hawaiians who are struggling to meet the costs of their post-secondary education. These programs are predominantly sponsored by the state university system, as well as by other state-based charitable foundations.

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any financial aid for college, Hawaiian students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required by both state and independent scholarship and grant sponsors, and is used to determine a student's eligibility for financial assistance. Once they have submitted their FAFSA, students will receive their Student Aid Report

(http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/nextsteps/student-aid-report), or SAR, which will outline their expected family

<!-- image -->

contribution (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm) as well as the levels of financial aid for which they have qualified. College-bound students, regardless of state of residence, should make the FAFSA their first priority when searching for financial aid for college.

## Scholarships and Grants from the University of Hawai'i System

Hawaii's state university system consists of ten colleges, and more than a dozen community colleges and research centers, located throughout the island chain. These institutions are governed by the University of Hawai'i System (http://www.hawaii.edu/about/). The UHS regulates all aspects of Hawaii's state-based postsecondary institutions, including administering a variety of scholarships and grants for resident students attending any one of the state's public colleges or universities.

The following financial aid programs are administered by the University of Hawai'i System for resident students attending a state run college, university, or community college. Students may apply for any of the following scholarships and grants through their school's offices of financial aid.

- The  Regents  Scholarship  (http://www.hawaii.edu/finaid/scholarships/raps/regents-index.html)  is  a  meritbased award available to first-year college students with an outstanding academic history. Eligible students must  have  a  combined  SAT  score  of  1950,  and  must  have  a  minimum  GPA  of  3.5.  This  is  a  full  tuition scholarship,  and  recipients  will  also  be  given  a  $2000  stipend  per  semester  plus  a  one-time  $2000  travel grant. Twenty Regents Scholarships are awarded each year.

Recipients of the Presidential Scholarship will also receive a stipend of $2000 per semester plus a $2000 travel grant.
- The Centennial Scholars Program  (http://www.hawaii.edu/finaid/scholarships/centennial/index.html) was designed to support Hawaii's best and brightest students by providing a $1000 annual scholarship ($500 per semester) to qualified applicants.

- The  Second  Century  Scholarship  (http://www.hawaii.edu/finaid/scholarships/index.php)  is  a  need-based award available to Native Hawaiian students who can demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. The scholarship is available to all Native Hawaiians attending any University of Hawai'i System institution. Award amounts vary, and are determined by the applicant's financial need and the availability of funds.
- The  State  of  Hawai'i  B  Plus  Scholarship  (http://www.hawaii.edu/svpa/ep/e6/e6206.pdf)  is  open  to  state residents who are recent graduates of an Hawaii public high school. Eligible students must have a minimum 3.0 GPA, and must be preparing to enroll in a state college or university. This is a need-based award, and final determination will be based on the students financial status.
- The University of Hawai'i Manoa Chancellor's Scholarship (http://manoa.hawaii.edu/admissions/undergrad/financing/chancellors\_scholarship.html)  is  available  to  fulltime first year freshman enrolled at the University of Hawaii's Manoa campus. Eligible students must have a minimum high school GPA of 3.5, and must have a minimum combined SAT score of 1600.

- The University of Hawai'i Hilo Chancellor's Scholarship (http://hilo.hawaii.edu/prospective/cseligibility.php) is awarded to qualified incoming freshman students enrolled at the University of Hawaii's Hilo campus. Students must have a minimum 3.5 GPA, and a combined SAT score of 1800 or better. This is a full tuition scholarship, and recipients  will  be  expected  to  remain  enrolled  full  time  and  to  maintain  a  minimum  3.25  GPA.  Fifteen scholarships are awarded each year.

These are just a few of the many scholarship and grant opportunities open to resident college-bound students of the great state of Hawaii. A great number of independently funded financial aid opportunities are also available for Hawaiian students looking to fund their college education.

## Getting College Financial Aid As A Student In Delaware

## Make Your Hard Work Pay Off

Delaware's state legislature understands the importance of encouraging its residents to pursue a college education. The state's governing body recognizes that a well educated populace is one of the keys to a vibrant and healthy local economy.

In an effort to make college more accessible to its residents and to reward the hard working students within its borders, Delaware offers a wide range of grants and scholarships designed to make a college education more affordable. These programs are a combination of need-based and meritbased awards, and are administered through Delaware's Higher Education Office (http://www.doe.k12.de.us/infosuites/students\_family/dheo/default.shtml). Save

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any state-based financial aid, resident students in the great state of Delaware must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The information students supply on their FAFSA is used to determine their eligibility for any Federal or state sponsored financial aid for college. The FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities, as well as the majority of independent scholarship sponsors, in determining a students eligibility for an award, and in setting the final award amounts. Resident students of the First State should make the FAFSA a top priority in their search for college funding.

## General Scholarships and Grants

The state of Delaware offers a full range of general scholarships and grants for its resident college-bound students. These programs are a mix of merit-based and need-based awards, and are designed to help state residents cover tuition costs at participating state colleges and universities. A variety of general

## Financial Aid for Specialized Studies

In addition to the wide range of general scholarships and grants available to state residents, Delaware also offers a number of financial aid programs targeting students with very specific career goals. These programs address the need of the state to recruit and retain professionals in critical need areas such as healthcare and education. These are award-for-service programs, in which students receive full or partial loan forgiveness in exchange for a commitment to work within the state at their chosen profession for a predetermined term of service.

The state of Delaware currently offers the following career specific financial aid programs:

- The Delaware Nursing Incentive Program (http://www.doe.k12.de.us/infosuites/students\_family/dheo/how\_to\_apply/financial\_aid/FA\_webpages/nursing.shtml) - This program is open to undergraduate students enrolled full time in accredited program leading to certification as a licensed RN or LPN.

To be eligible, applicants must have graduated within the top 50% of their high school class and must have a minimum SAT score of 1750. Participants in the program must agree to teach a critical need  subject  at  a  state  middle  school  or  high  school.

The program is open to advanced healthcare professionals within the state who have outstanding federal and state loans. Eligible professionals include primary care physician, oncologists, general practice dentists,  nurse  practitioners,  physician's  assistants,  and  clinical  psychologists.  Participants  may  be  eligible  to  receive  between  $35,000  and $70,000 in loan forgiveness in exchange for two years of service at a state healthcare facility.

Resident students of Delaware have access to some of the most impressive financial aid programs offered by any state in the country. The scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs discussed here are only the tip of the iceberg.

## Specialized Scholarships and Grants

Ohio, like many states, makes provision for certain specialized grants and scholarships to address specific needs within the community. These may target certain groups of the state population, or may provide incentive for students to pursue specific career paths. The Ohio Board of Regents supports a variety of these specialized financial aid programs. The following examples illustrate the further funding opportunities available to Ohio residents looking to secure financial aid for their college education.

- The Ohio EPA Scholarhip (http://www.ohiosci.org/oeef-scholarship/) is a merit-based, nonrenewable scholarships for undergraduate students admitted to Ohio state or private colleges and universities studying in fields  specializing  in  environmental  science  or  environmental  engineering.

- The Nurses Student Loan Assistance Program (https://ohiohighered.org/nealp) is designed to help train, and retain, qualified nurses and nursing educators within the state of Ohio. The program provides loan assistance to  students  enrolled  in  a  pre-licensure  nursing  program  at  an  accredited  Ohio  college  or  university.  Loan amounts are currently set at $1500 per academic year. Students who commit to serve as full-time nurses, or nursing  instructors,  for  a  minimum  of  five  years  within  the  state  may  qualify  for  full,  or  partial,  loan forgiveness. Priority is given to those students who demonstrate the highest level of financial need.

- Scholarships for New York students can cover a significant portion of tuition and other educational expenses.

Most people know that living in New York, especially New York City, is expensive compared to most of the rest of the country. And few people know that better than college students.

## What is a New York Scholarship?

A New York scholarship refers to a scholarship that is given to a college student who is either from New York or who attends school in New York. New York scholarships and grants don't have to be paid back after graduation, so they're the best way to fund your education.

Scholarships don't just fall into your lap; you have to actively search and apply for them. One of the best ways to find scholarships is to look for ones that are particular to your interests, skills and other attributes. Geographic-based scholarships, like New York scholarships, are a perfect example of one way to narrow your search and find the most attractive scholarships.

## Where to find New York Scholarships

If you're already enrolled in college, your financial aid department should have information about different scholarships you can apply for. Also, your department's academic advisor may also have ideas on how to find scholarships for your specific major. You can also ask professors, supervisors and other adults you know about potential scholarships.

The New York State Department of Education is also a good starting spot for scholarships. Just be aware that you should also take the time to do your own research. Start by writing down a list of everything about you, from where you live to what you want to study. Then, do a Google search for those adjectives plus the word 'scholarship.'

For example, if you're part of the marching band and/or play an instrument, look up 'music scholarships.' You can even get more granular and look up 'New York music scholarships.'

Rinse and repeat this process for all the words on your list. If you're having trouble brainstorming, talk to a parent, teacher or coach to see if they can help you come up with a list.

## How to apply for New York scholarships

Applying for a New York scholarship is similar to applying for any other kind of award. As always, you should make sure you understand the eligibility rules and requirements. Geographic scholarships often have specific residency requirements.

For example, you may have to have been a New York resident for a certain period of time to be eligible. These types of scholarships may also require that you attend school in New York.

Once you determine that you are eligible, read through the required documents. Many New York scholarships require at least one essay and a letter of recommendation. Applying for a scholarship can take time because you have to gather all of the necessary documents, write your essay and wait for someone to write a letter of recommendation.

Try to give yourself plenty of time to complete the application and start as early as possible. The more time you give yourself, the less likely it is that you'll make a mistake that could get you disqualified.

Many scholarships require that students submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is the overarching form that gives students access to federal financial aid, such as federal student loans, grants and work-study.

What most students don't know is that many scholarships also use the FAFSA to determine eligibility. This is most common with need-based scholarships, but also comes up with

merit-based awards. Even if you don't think you'll qualify for need-based aid, you should always fill out the FAFSA.

Some even require that students submit the CSS Profile, which is another kind of college financial aid form. Many scholarships will have their own form with other questions.

## Financial Aid In Missouri

## Score Some Extra Cash This Semester

The 'Show Me State' offers widespread educational opportunities for students pursuing associate's, bachelor's, master's and other advanced degrees. Missouri State, Saint Louis University, College of the Ozarks (http://www.cofo.edu/) and University of Missouri (http://www.umsl.edu/) draw interest from high school graduates nationwide - alongside a host of worthy state schools.

Missouri students of higher education draw from a variety of financial aid resources to meet college costs. Grants, scholarships and loans are key features of successful educational financing efforts for needy state students. Resources range from need-based grants that help disadvantaged applicants, to merit-based scholarships that recognize athletic and academic high-achievers.  State-sponsored student aid initiatives originate from the Missouri Department of Higher Education (http://www.dhe.mo.gov/), and supplement large scale federal financial aid programs.

Additional financial aid is put forth for specific purposes, like promoting diversity and bolstering enrollment in certain educational programs.  In Missouri,  students enjoy access to financial assistance for college that is:

- Job-Specific -  Nursing  (https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm), engineering, teaching and other fields  (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/subject-specific.htm)  are  promoted  with  scholarship opportunities.
- Student-Specific -Some  funding targets specific segments of the student body; like minorities (https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm), women and disabled persons (https://www.collegescholarships.org/disabilities.htm).
- Institution-Specific -  Individual  colleges  and  universities  maintain  campus-specific  student  assistance efforts.

<!-- image -->

## Need-Based Financial Assistance

The first step toward landing valuable financial aid for college is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA).  The standardized application helps the U.S. Department of Education (http://www.ed.gov/) - as well as individual campus financial aid offices - compute your financial requirements for college.  The cost of attending your school, your family's expected contribution and your personal income are used to determine how much assistance you need.

States use the same data to qualify you for student aid, so it is important to file your FAFSA according to Missouri deadlines, rather than federally imposed submission guidelines.  Beyond Federal Pell Grants

(https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm) and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans (http://www.direct.ed.gov/student.html), look to these Missouri resources for need-based support:

Access Missouri Financial Assistance Program (http://dhe.mo.gov/ppc/grants/accessmo.php) is a straightforward State Government initiative designed to increase access to college for disadvantaged state students.

- Attend a participating Missouri Institution of Higher

(http://dhe.mo.gov/files/participatingschools.pdf)

- Have an EFC below $12,000
- Pursue first degree

Circumstances dictate award amounts, but these standards reflect minimums and maximums for some students:

- Public two-year students are eligible for funding worth $300-$1000 annually
- Four-year college enrollees qualify for $100o-$2150
- students attending participating private universities are eligible for $200-$4600

Portability allows funding to be transferred between schools that participate in the program.

The incentive aims to retain Missouri's top scholastic talent by providing scholarship resources to those who continue post-secondary education at colleges and universities within the state.

For part-time students enrolled at Missouri two and four-year colleges, the Marguerite Ross Barnett Memorial Scholarship (http://dhe.mo.gov/ppc/grants/rossbarnett.php) offers $900-$1,700 to cover tuition costs. This award is not available to high school students.  Instead, it is designed to support college students who work fulltime, while pursuing college credentials on a part-time basis.

Successful applicants graduate in the top 10% of their high school classes and score in the top 10% on ACT standardized testing. Most awards are between $1,100 and $1,500.

Academically gifted students in the St. Louis area who have limited financial means for higher education are invited to apply for financial assistance from the William L. Clay Scholarship and Research Fund (http://www.wlcsrf.org/WLCSRF/Scholarship.html).  The organization has been awarding scholarships since 1983, to full-time students pursuing bachelor's degrees at Missouri colleges and universities.

## Job-Specific Student Assistance opportunities

State residents currently employed in Missouri, and those already enrolled at accredited institutions of higher learning are encouraged to apply.

Like other state schools, The University of Missouri- Saint Louis participates in ROTC Scholarship Programs (http://www.umsl.edu/%7Eumslrotc/Student%20Information/Scholarships.html).  Awards are designed to benefit graduating high school seniors, as well as ROTC students that are already attending college. The Scholarships are issued based on each applicant's grades and merit, rather than addressing need-based criteria.  The ROTC stable of aid includes two-year, three-year and four-year options, depending on the number of remaining semesters each applicant is required to complete, in order to earn his or her degree.  Specific programs also attract aid, like Army Nursing Scholarships for educating health care providers.

Crowder College, in Neosho Missouri, requires students to submit FAFSA applications, in order to be considered for campus aid.  The school operates a Work Study Program (http://www.crowder.edu/student-services/financialaid/workstudy.php) that helps students pay for college by serving in agricultural, custodial and clerical positions on campus.  Several Crowder Scholarships reward outstanding athletes from sports like women's basketball, women's softball and men's baseball.  Curricular areas specifically targeted for scholarship funding at Crowder include:

- Business Administration
- Art and Design
- Journalism
- Music

College of the Ozarks Cost of Education Scholarship (http://www.cofo.edu/Page/Admissions/FinancialAid.50.html) provides supplemental funding designed to fully finance each student's education.  The school uses a well-established work program to help students offset tuition costs and increase affordability for needy enrollees.  On the College of the Ozarks campus, each student participates in a 15 hour/week work-study program (plus two 40-hour weeks during breaks), to earn around $4000 during the school year.  Earnings are combined with each student's Federal and State financial aid awards, to comprise the bulk of each participant's

college funding package.  Whatever financial obligations remain after these resources have been applied are addressed by Cost of Education Scholarships.  Scholarship values do not exceed annual attendance costs, which are equivalent to approximately $17,000 per student.

## Connecticut College Financial Aid Programs

## Get Your Share from the Government

The state of Connecticut supports a variety of financial aid programs for its resident college-bound students. Sponsored by the state, these programs are administered through the Connecticut Office of Higher Education (http://www.ctohe.org/), and the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education

(http://www.ctregents.org/). Connecticut's financial aid programs include merit-based and need-based grants and scholarships, as well as tuition waivers and loan-forgiveness plans for students pursuing professional degrees in critical need disciplines.

## First Step - The FAFSA

Students pursuing any state or Federal financial aid must first fill out, and submit, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/), or FAFSA. The information students provide on their FAFSA application is used to generate a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which outlines the levels of government financial aid for which the student is eligible. All state and Federal financial aid programs are dependent upon the submission of the FAFSA, and students should make this a priority before beginning their search for any form of college funding.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Students from the Constitution State have access to a variety of general scholarships and grants designed to help them realize their college ambitions. Connecticut offers both need-based and merit-based financial aid programs as a way to make higher education more accessible to all. The following examples demonstrate the scholarship and grant opportunities that are available to residents students in the state of Connecticut.

- The Connecticut Capitol Scholarship is  available  to  high  school  seniors who graduate in the top 20% of their class, with a minimum SAT score of 1800. Eligible students may receive up to $2000 per year to be used at a state college or university. Awards are decided by academic merit and financial need. Students can apply through the offices of their high school guidance counselor.
- The Connecticut Aid for Public College Students provides financial assistance to students enrolled in a 2year  or  4-year  state  supported  public  college  or  university.  To  be  eligible,  students  must  demonstrate  the requisite  level  of  financial  need.  Award  amounts  vary.  Students  may  apply  through  their  college's  office  of financial aid.
- The Connecticut Independent College Student Grant Program is available to resident students attending an approved independent college or university within the state. Students may receive up to $7,875 in financial assistance per year. Awards are determined by financial need. Students must apply through their college or university's office of financial aid.
- The  Connecticut  Veterans  Tuition  Waiver  (http://www.ctohe.org/edinfo/pdfs/VeteransTuitionWaiver.pdf)  is available to veterans, and active members of the Connecticut Army and Air National Guard. Tuition waivers are also available to the dependent children and surviving spouses of military service-members killed in action after September 11, 2001. Interested students should apply through their college's office of financial aid, or its office of veteran's affairs.
- The  Connecticut  Senior  Citizen Tuition Waiver  (http://www.ctohe.org/edinfo/pdfs/SeniorCitizen.pdf) is available  to  resident  students  aged  62  or  older  who  are  returning  to  school  at  one  of  the  state's  public colleges.  The  tuition  waiver  is  only  offered  after  all  other  class  registration  has  been  completed,  and  is contingent upon the availability of space in the desired course.
- The  College  Access  Grant  (http://www.ctregents.org/initiatives/grant)  is  supported  by  Federal  and  state funds,  and  is  designed  to  increase  access  to  higher  education  for  traditionally  under-represented  students. Award amounts vary according to college, financial need, and availability of funds. Students should contact their high school guidance counselor, or their college's office of financial aid, for application information.

## Career Specific Financial Aid

Connecticut offers a single career specific financial aid program for its resident students. It addresses the need for qualified teachers within the state, and the need to promote diversity within the state's teaching population.

- The Connecticut Minority Teacher Incentive Grant/Weisman Teacher Scholarship (http://www.ctohe.org/SFA/pdfs/MTIPForm.pdf) is available to minority students in their junior or senior year of a teaching program at a state college or university. To be eligible students must be nominated by the Dean of Education from their college or university. Approved recipients may receive up to $5000 per year in grant money, renewable for 2 years. Students who agree to a four year teaching contract in a Connecticut public school following graduation may also be eligible for a loan reimbursement of $2500 per completed year of their contract.

## Connecticut Student Loans

Resident students of the Constitution State also have access to low cost, fixed interest, loans through the Connecticut Higher Education Supplemental Loan Authority (http://www.chesla.org/). Much like Federal education loans, CHESLA offers student friendly loans as an alternative to private lenders. These loans offer many advantages over private lender loans. CHESLA loans currently offer fixed interest rates of 5.95%, and interest only payment plans for as long as the student remains enrolled in college. There are no application fees, and students may borrow up to the total cost of tuition, less any other approved financial aid.

Students in Connecticut have access to some of the best colleges and universities in the nation, and with the help and support of the Connecticut Office of Higher Education (http://www.ctohe.org/), and the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education (http://www.ctregents.org/) they also have access to financial aid programs designed to help them make their college dreams a reality.

## Are You A Resident Of Or Studying In Indiana?

## Scholarship and Grant Programs

The state government of Indiana recognizes the value of continued education, and works hard to encourage and support its residents in their pursuit of a college degree. Through the state's Division of Student Financial Aid (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/index.htm), Indiana administers a variety of scholarships and grants designed to help resident students meet the ever rising costs of a college education. These financial aid programs take many forms. Some are general grants and scholarships that provide much needed funds to students regardless of their major or ultimate career goal. Others are subject specific, and have been developed to encourage students to pursue careers in certain high need professions such as teaching and healthcare. Whether decided on the basis of academic merit or financial need, these financial aid programs share one common goal - to make college more accessible to the residents of the Hoosier State.

## The Importance of the FAFSA

The first step in applying for any state-based financial aid for college is the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is a requirement for all students applying for any Federal or state-based scholarships, grants or loans. The information students provide on their FAFSA application is used to determine their eligibility for any and all government financial assistance. The FAFSA is also used by most colleges, universities, and independent financial aid advisory boards to determine a student's eligibility for any available grants or scholarships.

<!-- image -->

Indiana residents who are interested in applying for any state-based grants, scholarships or loan forgiveness programs should make the submission of their FAFSA a top priority.

## General Scholarships and Grant Programs

The state of Indiana offers a variety of general grants and scholarships for its resident students. These programs are applicable to all college-bound residents of Indiana who are enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in a state college or university. As with all state supported financial aid for college  students, programs are subject to change without notice according to availability of funds.

The following general scholarships and grants are currently being sponsored by the state of Indiana.

- The  Mitch  Daniels  Early  Graduation  Scholarship  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2504.htm)  is  offered  to  students who graduate at least one year early from a public high school within the state of Indiana. The scholarship is valued at $4000, and can be used at any participating Indiana college or university. This is a one time award, and can not be renewed. Students who opt to take the GED prior to graduation are not eligible.
- The  Frank  O'Bannon  Grant  Program  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2346.htm),  formerly  known  as  the  Indiana Higher Education Grant, is a need-based award for high school graduates, or GED holders, who are enrolled in an undergraduate program at a state college or university. To be eligible, students must be enrolled full time in a course of study leading to an associate's degree. Award amounts vary according to available funding, and the annual number of applicants.
- The 21st Century Scholars Program (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2345.htm) provides full tuition scholarships to participating 7th and 8th grade students who meet the income eligibility requirements. Students must enroll in  the  program  while  in  high  school,  must  maintain  an  acceptable  GPA,  and  must  fulfill  a  pledge  of  good

- citizenship. Recipients of the award will receive up to four years of undergraduate tuition at a participating state college or university.
- The Indiana National Guard Supplemental Grant (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2339.htm) is available to eligible members  of  the  Indiana  Air  and  Army  National  Guard.  Grant  amounts  are  based  on  30  credit  hours  per academic year, and recipients must maintain status as a full time student at a participating state college or university. Applicants must be in active drilling status, and must not have been AWOL at any time within a 12 month period prior to enrollment.
- The  Children  of  Veteran  and  Public  Safety  Officer  Supplemental  Grant  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2338.htm) provides  tuition  assistance  to  the  dependent  children  of  disabled  Indiana  veterans,  and  to  the  dependent children and spouses of police officers and firefighters who have been killed in the line of duty. The grant pays up to 100% of tuition costs at an approved state college or university.
- The  Indiana  Part-Time  Grant  Award  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2362.htm)  has  been  designed  to  provide financial assistance to students who are enrolled for at least 2 credit hours, but no more than 12 credit hours, at  a  state  college,  university,  community  college  or  vocational  school.  The  Part-Time  Grant  Award  is  term based, and is renewable for each semester. The minimum award is $50 per term.

## Career Specific Financial Aid

Like many states across the country, Indiana is suffering from a critical shortage of qualified teachers and nurses. As a way to address the shortfall, the state has implemented two scholarship programs designed to encourage and support students who choose to pursue careers in these high need fields.

The following career specific scholarships are currently being offered by the state of Indiana for its resident students.

- The  Indiana  Nursing  Scholarship  (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2343.htm)  was  created  in  1990  to  encourage students to pursue degrees and careers in nursing. To be eligible, students must be accepted to an approved nursing  program  at  a  state  institute  of  higher  education,  must  have  a  minimum  GPA  of  2.0,  and  must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. This is an award-for-service scholarship, and recipients must agree to work at a critical need healthcare facility within the state for a minimum of 2 years. The maximum annual  award  is  $5000,  and  the  scholarship  is  renewable  for  as  long  as  the  student  meets  the  eligibility requirements.
- The Minority Teacher/Special Services Scholarship (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/2342.htm) was created in 1988 to address the critical shortage of African-American and Hispanic-American teachers within the state of Indiana. Eligible applicants must be pursuing a teaching certificate at a state college or university. While non-minority students may apply, preference is given to students of African-American and Hispanic-American descent. The maximum annual award is $4000 for minority students, and $1000 for non-minority students. The scholarship is renewable for as long as the student can meet the program requirements.

The Indiana Commission for Higher Education (http://www.in.gov/che/) is determined to make a college education more accessible to students in the Hoosier State. Through the Division of Student Financial Aid (http://www.in.gov/ssaci/index.htm), the CHE administers a wide variety of valuable grants and scholarships designed to make college more affordable for the resident students of Indiana.

## Student Financial Aid In Nebraska

## Read This Before You Contact a Bank

Much of Nebraska is rural, with more than 82% of the state devoted to farmland. But that doesn't mean that Nebraska doesn't offer its residents an impressive post-secondary education system. The Cornhusker State can boast 16 private colleges, 8 regional community and tribal colleges, and three state colleges. The University of Nebraska itself has five separate campus locations, and there are literally dozens of technical and vocational schools providing Nebraska's residents with career training in everything from cosmetology to auto repair. College-bound students in Nebraska will find that their state offers post-secondary educational opportunities that are the equal to any largely urban state.

## The Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education

(http://www.ccpe.state.ne.us/PublicDoc/Ccpe/) regulates the state's higher education system. The CCPE's mission is to enact the state legislature's policy decisions in regard to Nebraska's state and community colleges, as well as the University of Nebraska. The CCPE also administers a selection of financial aid programs designed to make a college education more accessible to residents of Nebraska.

## The First Step is The FAFSA

College-bound students in the state of Nebraska will need to first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) before they can apply for any Federal or state supported financial aid programs. The information students supply on the FAFSA is used to determine their Expected Family Contribution (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm), and their overall level of financial need. This information is then used to determine what levels of financial aid the student will be eligible to receive. The FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities, as well as the majority of independent sponsors of scholarships and grants, to decide a student applicant's eligibility for financial assistance.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Nebraska's Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education administers four financial aid programs designed to provide assistance to students who may not otherwise be able to afford a college education. These programs are funded by the state, and are only offered to legal residents who are attending one of Nebraska's state colleges or universities. As with any state supported financial aid, these programs are subject to change according to legislation and availability of funds.

The following financial aid programs are sponsored by the state of Nebraska for its resident college-bound students.

- The Access College Early Scholarship (http://www.ccpe.state.ne.us/PublicDoc/Ccpe/Financial%20Aid/ACE/default.asp)  is  available  to  low-income high  school  students  who  have  chosen  to  take  early  enrollment,  or  dual  enrollment,  at  one  of  the  state's public  colleges  or  universities.  Eligibility  is  determined  by  financial  need  and  academic  achievement.  To  be eligible, students will need to have completed an advanced high school curriculum.
- The ACE Plus Scholarship Program (http://www.ccpe.state.ne.us/PublicDoc/Ccpe/Financial%20Aid/ACEplus/default.asp) is open to full-time college students who previously qualified for an Access College Early Scholarship while in high school. The ACE Plus Scholarship awards $500 for the first year a student attends college full-time, and $1000 for the second year of full-time attendance. To be eligible, students must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA. Awards are granted on a first come, first served basis and students are encouraged to apply as early as possible for this award.
- The  Nebraska  Opportunity  Grant  (http://www.ccpe.state.ne.us/PublicDoc/Ccpe/NOG.asp)  is  available  to Nebraska residents who are attending a college or university within the state, and who have the minimum Expected Family Contribution as determined by their FAFSA application. The Nebraska Opportunity Grant is administered through the financial aid offices of colleges and universities within the state, and students will need to apply for the grant through their college of attendance.

Although Nebraska is a predominantly rural state, it still provides its residents with a first class post-secondary education system. College-bound students living in Nebraska should not feel that they need to leave the state to acquire the college education they desire. Through the financial aid opportunities administered by the Nebraska Coordinating Commission for Post-Secondary Education (http://www.ccpe.state.ne.us/PublicDoc/Ccpe/), residents of the Cornhusker State can find the money they need to make their college dreams a reality.

## What are Florida scholarships?

For qualified students around the state, Florida provides an extensive array of scholarship opportunities. Both undergraduate and graduate students seeking a college degree are eligible for these scholarships. A certain grade point average, a certain amount of credit hours completed, and proof of financial need are just a few of the eligibility conditions. Meritorious students can apply for scholarships based on their extracurricular activities, social action, community service, academic standing, and other criteria.

Scholarship programs are available at both public and private universities in Florida, including the esteemed Florida State University. For those who achieve exceptionally well, there are also merit-based and national scholarships available. These scholarships can help students fulfill their desire of attending college by offering financial support for additional costs such as tuition.

A portion of Florida scholarships are awarded to students who either now reside in Florida or want to do so in the future. For instance, a jazz musician from or enrolled in school in Orange, Seminole, Osceola, Brevard, Lake, or Volusia counties gets awarded the CFJS Scholarship.

Others, on the other hand, will demand that students live in Florida and attend classes there. For instance, the University of Floria offers the Armando J. de Moya Scholarship to a resident of Florida who is majoring in civil engineering.

Certain Florida scholarships are intended for certain majors or interests, while others are available to most kinds of students. One scholarship that is awarded to students pursuing a bachelor's degree in welding engineering or welding engineering technology is the AWS Airgas Terry Jarvis Memorial Scholarship.

## How to apply for a Florida scholarship

The process of applying for a scholarship in Florida is very similar to that of applying for any other type of award. The most important thing to think about is if you qualify. Knowing if you must dwell in or be enrolled in school in that state is crucial for any type of geographic scholarship. When looking for scholarships in Florida, keep in mind that some are restricted to students from particular counties or regions.

If there is an essay component, start working on it sooner rather than later. If you're having trouble, you can ask a teacher to help brainstorm ideas or read a first draft. If the scholarship requires a letter of recommendation, make a list of possible candidates and ask them as soon as possible. Most adults need at least a few weeks' notice so they can craft a compelling letter.

## University-Based Scholarships at Florida State University (FSU)

To qualified students, Florida State University (FSU) provides a variety of university-based scholarships. These scholarships support worthy students financially so they can continue their college studies.

The requirements for these scholarships differ based on the program, but generally speaking they take into account things like Grade Point Average (GPA), academic standing, extracurricular activity, and community service. Certain scholarships could come with extra conditions or considerations, such studying in a certain degree program or being a firstgeneration college student.

Undergraduate students must submit both the FSU general scholarship application and the Florida Financial Aid Application in order to be eligible for these scholarships. For information about scholarships, or eligibility requirements graduate students should get in touch with the relevant department or institution.

At FSU, university-based scholarships have award values ranging from few hundred dollars to full tuition reimbursement. Certain scholarships are renewable, so if the recipient maintains their eligibility over time, they may continue to get the money.

Students can look for more scholarships based on their unique requirements by visiting the Scholarship Search Engines area of FSU's website. Finding national scholarships and other chances to augment university-based aid can be done with the help of this useful website.

All things considered, FSU's university-based scholarships offer worthy and high-achieving students significant financial assistance. These scholarships, which are available to both new and returning students, can lower your tuition costs and support your academic performance at FSU.

## Private Organizations Offering Local and Regional Scholarships in Florida

Apart from university and college scholarship programs, there are several private organizations in Florida that grant local and regional scholarships to qualified students. For those seeking a college education, these scholarships are an invaluable source of funding.

In Florida, private groups typically establish particular qualifications for their scholarship offerings.

Before submitting an application, students should thoroughly research and fulfill the conditions of each organization since they will vary.

Usually, to apply for these scholarships, one must submit an application form and any other supporting materials, including an essay, recommendation letters, and transcripts.

To stay on pace with federal efforts, and provide supplementary assistance, states offer their own brands of financial aid for college students.  When federal resources, from the Pell Grant (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm)program and the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/direct.htm) run dry, Montana students of higher education use state-specific funding (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/state.htm) to meet tuition obligations.

Whether you are a resident or non-resident, there are a number of state programs available to underwrite Montana higher education costs. The Office of Public Instruction (http://opi.mt.gov/)provides a limited number of programs, and the Montana State University System (http://mus.edu/)supports its academic programs with a number of scholarships and grants.  Awards are issued by public and private agencies, including need-based and merit-based options for qualified applicants.  Candidates also participate in student-specific financial aid (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm) initiatives designed to benefit particular groups, like Montana's Native American population.

## Montana State Government Scholarship and Grant Programs

The Montana Governor's Post-secondary Scholarship is a need and merit-based incentive. The Best and Brightest Program (http://mus.edu/Prepare/Pay/Scholarships/Governors\_Best\_and\_Brightest\_Scholarship.asp) is designed to make college education more accessible to Montana residents, and to keep greater numbers of state graduates living and working within their home state. Eligible candidates maintain a GPA of 2.5, and submit timely FAFSA applications. Awards are valued in the range of $1000 - $2000 each.

## The federally-funded Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program

(http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) selects honors-level high school seniors, and provides financial assistance for stand-out academics throughout the state. Selected  students are already accepted into four-year college programs, maintaining high academic standards.

The U.S. Senate Youth Program (http://www.hearstfdn.org/ussyp/) promotes the activities of students immersed in campus-government organizations. Funded by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, this scholarship program chooses two students annually, from more than 100 'student delegates,' to receive $5000 scholarships. Applicants are required to complete rigorous examinations,  and participate in oral interviews.

## Montana State University Scholarships and Grants

Montana college hopefuls apply with high scores on ACT and SAT tests. Awards are valued at as much as $7500 per academic year, for each recipient.

MSU's Resident Freshman University Scholarships (http://www.montana.edu/admissions/scholarshipsres.shtml) are merit-based incentives benefiting Montana residents who are incoming freshman.

Western Undergraduate Exchange Awards (http://www.montana.edu/admissions/scholarships.shtml) allow certain students to receive in-state tuition at Montana schools, in exchange for reciprocal treatment at western colleges outside the state.  Participants attend schools like MSU-Bozeman.

MSU's Presidential Scholarships (http://www.montana.edu/wwwuhp/pages/scholarships.html) are awarded to incoming freshman with demonstrated high levels of academic and personal achievement. Non-residents are awarded the Presidential Scholarships, and may also qualify for resident tuition status.

Native American Scholarships (http://www.montana.edu/admissions/nativescholarships.shtml) are available for MSU students with proven tribal affiliations. These scholarships are are issued based on need and merit.

Montana's Indian Fee Waiver (http://mus.edu/Prepare/Pay/Tuition\_and\_Fee\_Waivers.asp) makes it possible for residents with at least ¼ Native American blood to receive tuition abatement for higher education.

MSU's Bozeman campus has instituted the Native American Non-Resident Tribal Homelands Scholarship (http://www.montana.edu/admissions/images/HomelandsScholarshipInfoSheet.pdf), designated for Native American students affiliated with the Montana tribal nation. Awards are valued as much as $10,000 each.

## College Funding In New Hampshire

## Do You Need Help with Tuition?

College students seeking aid are well-served by federal financial assistance like Pell Grants (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/pell.htm) and Direct Loans (https://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/direct.htm), but supplemental resources are available at the state level too.  In New Hampshire, the  Division of Higher Education - Higher Education Commission (http://www.education.nh.gov/highered/) administers the state's scholarships and grant programs.

The University System of New Hampshire (http://www.usnh.edu/) maintains a solid academic tradition, with public colleges and universities totalling

12 state institutions.  Statewide, the system includes The University of New Hampshire campuses, Keene State College (http://www.keene.edu/admissions/aid/), and the campuses of Granite State College and Plymouth State University (http://www.plymouth.edu/). In addition, several campus locations make up the Community College System of New Hampshire (http://www.ccsnh.edu/).

State resources include general student assistance, as well as targeted initiatives that promote workforce development for specific professions. Landing New Hampshire financial aid starts with a timely-filed FAFSA (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/).  The Free Application for Federal Student Aid provides vital data for state financial aid administrators, who use it to evaluate each applicant's level of financial need.  Use the following New Hampshire resources to augment your federal financial aid awards.

## General Scholarships and Grants

The Scholarships for Orphans of Veterans

<!-- image -->

(http://www.education.nh.gov/highered/finanical/documents/vet\_scholarship\_app.pdf) program is in-place to reward families that make the ultimate sacrifice for service to country. New Hampshire students who have lost a parent in armed conflict qualify for up to $2500 each academic year, for tuition at in-state public colleges and universities.

New Hampshire Tuition Waiver Program for Foster Children (http://www.education.nh.gov/highered/finanical/index.htm) provides higher education assistance for current and former foster care children attending state schools.  To qualify, applicants were in state foster care during the six-month period immediately prior to turning 18, or were in state guardianship on their 18th birthdays.

Federally funded Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html)are designated for the academic uppercrust in New Hampshire higher education.  Funding is issued from the Federal Government, to individual state education agencies.  Participating states, like New Hampshire, then administer the scholarships to eligible applicants. Dozens of graduating high school honors-level seniors are recognized annually as Byrd Honors Scholars. Applicants are nominated on the strength of GPA, class rank, ACT/SAT scores and other scholastic accomplishments.

## Specialized Studies Programs

- * Important Notice:  Due to budgetary constraints, several New Hampshire financial aid initiatives have been discontinued.  The following entries are maintained as historical references, and to provide information should these New Hampshire student assistance programs become operative in the future.

The New Hampshire Incentive Program is a need-based fund designed to make college more affordable for New Hampshire students.  Reciprocal grants allow New Hampshire students to attend colleges within the state, or at a participating school in one of the other New England states (Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island).  The New England Association of Schools and Colleges (http://www.neasc.org/) oversees the grants, worth up to $1000 per academic year, which are issued based on FAFSA findings.

Save

Leveraged Incentive Grants are provided for New Hampshire students attending state colleges and universities. Eligibility is based on financial need and academic merit. Awards are valued at up to $7500 per academic year. Applications are considered by individual colleges.

Academically talented students qualify for the state's Granite State Scholars (http://www.education.nh.gov/recognition/granite\_state.htm) program. This merit-based program offers features designed to keep top students enrolled at participating state colleges (Keene State, University of New Hampshire and Plymouth State University). High acheivers are encouraged to apply directly through their school.

New Hampshire's Workforce Incentive Program provides additional grants to students who choose study paths in critical shortage professions. such as: Nursing, teaching, math, and foreign languages. The program offers loan forgiveness or loan repayment, in exchange for service at high need facilities in the state. Eligible candidates must be enrolled at participating New Hampshire institutions, and willing to fulfill work obligations following graduation.

Just as in other states, the shortage of teachers has inspired New Hamphire State Government to proactively recruit qualified students into the field (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm). New Hampshire high school juniors and seniors have the opportunity to participate in a career prep program called Exploring the Art of Teaching. Students who participate are offered incentives to pursue teaching as a career - particularly within the state. Participants also qualify for consideration for the Future Educators Academy Scholarship. Students enrolled in state teaching programs, either two-year or four-year, qualify for aid worth between $5000 and $10,000 annually.  Particpants agree to the stipulation that they teach in the New Hampshire public school system following graduation.

Students pursuing allopathic medicine or veterinary medicine are eligible for the Medical Education Program or the Veterinary Education Program. These tuition 'capitation' programs provide affordable ways for New Hampshire residents to study at fine institutions, including Dartmouth (http://www.dartmouth.edu/), Cornell and Tufts University (http://www.tufts.edu/).

## College Financial Aid From Virginia

## Find Financial Aid in Virginia

The State of Virginia embodies a rich academic tradition with roots planted in the foundations of the country. Prestigious schools like Washington and Lee University carry presidential monikers, because the founding fathers actually founded the schools.  Virginia Military Institute (http://www.vmi.edu/), in Lexington, VA represents the underpinnings of military education, on par with the Citadel and Westpoint, and a host of state preparatory academies provide student-soldiers to fill the school's ranks.

State colleges, like University of Virginia (http://www.virginia.edu/), in Charlottesville boast strong business and health programs that serve high-need fields like nursing and the business-technology sector.  Exclusive private colleges like Hollins and Virginia Intermont College (http://vic.edu/) fill vital educational roles, and are recognized for the effort, by government-backed financial aid programs for private school students.  Look to these, and other Virginia financial aid resources to provide college funding solutions.

<!-- image -->

## Scholarships:

## The Lee-Jackson Foundation

To recognize the educational contributions of two great Virginia generals, the Lee-Jackson Foundation (http://www.lee-jackson.org/) supports college students, with scholarships and grants.  Since 1953, the Foundation hosts an annual essay competitions to review outstanding essays from high school students that

demonstrate an appreciation for the character and virtues of Generals Robert E Lee and Thomas J 'Stonewall' Jackson. Essays are judged with an emphasis on three primary features:

- 1.  Accuracy of historical depictions
- 2.  Research depth and quality
- 3.  Clarity of ideas and written expression

Eighteen annual scholarships are disbursed to juniors and seniors from the eight High School regions in the state.  Each region awards one $2000 scholarship, and one $1000 scholarship, for a total of sixteen awards.  An additional pair of scholarships is reserved for private school students and those coming from home-schooled situations; one valued at $2000 and the other $1000.  The most outstanding essay submitted garners the top prize, which includes an additional $8000 worth of scholarship funding for the grand prize winner.  The top annually earner, then, receives a total of $10,000 toward college expenses.

Virginia residents attending accredited four-year colleges and universities within the state are invited to compete for Lee-Jackson Foundation Scholarships.

## Granville P. Meade Scholarship

Valuable financial aid resources originate from the Virginia Department of Education (http://www.doe.virginia.gov/), which funds higher education for state students.  Grants and scholarships administered by the state provide supplemental funding for Virginia college students whose federal financial aid does not make ends meet. Qualifications vary, based on individual eligibility parameters, but state resources address college funding shortfalls for a wide range of students

(https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/student-specific.htm).

## The Granville P. Meade Scholarship

(http://www.doe.virginia.gov/instruction/virginia\_scholarships/granville\_meade/index.shtml) helps Virginia high school seniors transition to attendance at Virginia's public or private colleges and universities. Meade funding is reserved for academic high-achievers whose economic situation does not accommodate higher education expenses.  College affordability is inspired by state-sponsored college financing that provides $2000 each year, for up to four years.

Since Granville P Meade Scholarships are issued based on both need and merit, successful applicants demonstrate strong academic achievement, extracurricular participation and overall good character. Application materials include letters of reference and FAFSA results; high school guidance counselors and financial aid administrators are well-equipped to provide detailed information to Virginia high school seniors and incoming college freshmen.

## Grants:

## VTAG (Virginia Tuition Assistance Grant)

This state grant program provides annual tuition assistance for full-time Virginia residents attending  private colleges and universities across the state. The State Council of Higher Education (http://www.schev.edu/students/factsheetvtag.asp) puts forth these eligibility requirements for earning VTAG funding:

- Resident of Virginia
- Attend private college
- Attend accredited school
- Enroll at in-state institution of higher education
- Major in non-theological discipline
- Maintain full-time college enrollment
- Attend eligible institution, including Hollins University (http://www.hollins.edu/index.shtml), Hampton University, Bluefield College (http://www.bluefield.edu/) and approximately 30 other participating colleges.

Undergraduates and graduate students are eligible for this grant, provided qualifications are maintained. Although funding varies according to legislative approval, recent annual awards for undergraduates topped out at $2800 each.  Graduate students each qualify for $1300 a year, based on recent funding thresholds.

Emphasis for earning TAG money is placed on retaining talented students for Virginia schools.  As a result, nonresidents living in the state for the purpose of attending college are not considered for VTAG awards.

Applications and information (http://www.schev.edu/forms/TAGApplication1314.pdf) are available at private school financial aid offices and high school administrative departments.  Generally, members of the council of independent colleges in Virginia are eligible institutions.

## Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Program (VGAP)

The State of Virginia makes a strong statement with this educational assistance program:  'We help college-aged kids pay for school'.  The incentive serves to motivate primary and secondary school students to aspire toward higher education, regardless of the economic barriers that may exist.

The most valuable VGAP awards (http://www.schev.edu/Students/factsheetVGAP.asp) cover full tuition, books and other school expenses and those applicants with the highest levels of need receive at least the cost of tuition.  To qualify for VGAP, students must meet these standards of application:

- Accepted at 2 or 4 year Virginia school
- Enrolled in approved program
- Resident of the state
- U.S. Citizen
- Demonstrable need
- Minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5
- Graduate from High School - no GED candidates accepted. Home-schooled applicants must score 900 on SAT
- Dependent status on FAFSA application

To remain eligible, successful candidates stay enrolled full-time, and meet a minimum 2.0 GPA standard.  Need, state residency and satisfactory academic progress must be maintained to qualify for funding beyond each participant's initial award.

## Virginia Commonwealth Award Program

This program provides need based grants to undergraduate and graduate students. To qualify, undergraduate students are required to attend Virginia colleges and universities; while graduate students are permitted to attend in or out-of-state institutions.

## Undergraduates with financial need benefit from this grant program

(http://www.schev.edu/Students/factsheetCOMMA.asp) proportionately, so that the highest levels of financial assistance go to the state students who need the money most.  Eligibility requirements for the awards are straightforward, and do not deviate from most financial aid programs.  For example:

- Resident of Virginia
- Public two or four year college or university student
- Enrolled at least half-time
- Working toward a degree or certificate
- Display financial need
- US citizen or eligible non citizen.

Applications and candidate evaluations are handled by the individual colleges, universities, technical schools and other IHE that participate in the program, so the best resources for students seeking information are found among individual campus financial aid administrators.

## Scholarships And Grants In Oregon

## Couldn't We All Use Some Extra Cash?

Nearly every college-bound student will need to secure some level of financial aid to help them cover the costs of their post-secondary education. To answer the financial needs of their resident students, most states sponsor a variety of grants and scholarships designed to make a college education more accessible, and more affordable. Oregon is no exception, and currently offers a variety of scholarships and state-funded grants, for its resident students who are struggling to meet the rising costs of a college education.

Oregon's student aid programs are administered through the Oregon Student Assistance Commission (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/home.aspx), as well as through the financial aid offices of state supported colleges and universities. These programs are a mix of need-based and merit-based awards, and they provide valuable financial assistance to the resident students of the Beaver State.

<!-- image -->

## Submitting the FAFSA

The first step in any college-bound student's search for financial aid should be the submission of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used by Federal and state agencies to determine the levels of financial aid for which a given student is eligible. Once students have submitted their FAFSA, they will be issued with a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aidreport) which will outline the full extent of the financial assistance for which they have qualified.

Students should make the FAFSA a priority in their search for college funding. In addition to being a requirement for all state and Federal student aid, the FAFSA is also used by most colleges, private associations, and lending institutions to determine an applicant's eligibility for financial aid.

## Education Grants for Oregon Students

The state of Oregon sponsors a variety of education grants for its resident students. Eligibility requirements vary greatly among these programs, as do the monetary awards. As with all state-funded financial aid programs, funding is subject to change according to economic conditions within the state.

The following examples should illustrate the range of education grants available to Oregon's resident students.

- The  Oregon  Opportunity  Grant  (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/oregon-opportunity-grant.aspx)  is  the  state's largest need-based financial aid program. The OOG is available to undergraduate students who are enrolled at least half-time at an Oregon state college or university. Applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements, including having an annual gross income of less than $70,000. The maximum award allowance is $1950 per academic year.
- The  Chaffee  Education  and  Training  Grant  (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/chafeeetv.aspx)  provides  financial assistance to Oregon students who are in, or who have recently aged out of, the state's foster care system. Applicants must be aged 14 to 23 years, and must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. Award amounts vary, and are determined by need, and status as a full or part-time student. Awards range from $1000 - $3000.
- The Oregon Deceased or Disabled Public Safety Officer Grant (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/ddpso-grant.aspx) was designed to provide financial assistance to the dependents of public safety officers who have been killed, or disabled, in the line of duty. The grant is available to college aged children of firefighters, law enforcement personnel,  and  corrections  officers.  Applicants  must  be  enrolled  in  a  state  college  or  university.  Award amounts may not exceed the total costs of tuition, less any other financial aid already received.
- The Oregon Barber and Hairdresser Grant (http://oregonstudentaid.gov/barbers-grant.aspx) provides financial assistance  to  resident  students  who  are  enrolled  in  a  licensed  school  of  barbering,  hair  design,  or cosmetology.  Applicants  must  be  enrolled  full-time,  and  must  demonstrate  the  requisite  level  of  financial need. Award amounts vary according to availability of funds.

## Scholarships for Oregon Students

The Oregon Student Assistance Commission administers a wide variety of scholarships for students attending a college or university within the state. Most of these scholarships are funded through private endowments, or through corporate funding. The scholarship programs administered by the OSAC run the gamut from general need-based awards to highly specialized merit-based awards.

The following examples are just a few of the many scholarships available to residents students within the state of Oregon.

- The Bend Branch of AAUW Charles and Helen Weil Memorial Scholarship is available to students who have graduated, or completed 93 credit-hours, at Central Oregon Community College. Applicants must have a minimum  3.25  GPA,  and  must  be  continuing  their  education  at  a  state  supported  non-profit  college  or university. Awards are determined by financial need, and preference is given to female applicants.
- The Sehar Saleha Ahmad and Abrahim Ekramullah Zafar Foundation offers scholarships to female high school  graduates  who  are  enrolled,  or  preparing  to  enroll,  in  one  of  Oregon's  four-year  public  colleges. Students must be pursuing a degree in English, must have a 3.80 GPA, and must demonstrate the required level of financial need. Award amounts vary, and the scholarship is renewable.
- The Russ and Rose Otte Choir offers a one time scholarship to graduating seniors of Ashland High School who have participated in the school's choir, band, or orchestra for a minimum of 2 years. Applicants must be enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in a state supported college or university.
- The Ronald and Karel Bennett Scholarship is available to graduating seniors of any Jackson County High School who will be entering college as a Sophomore. Applicants must have a minimum 3.0 GPA, and must be pursuing degrees in accounting, architecture, business or engineering.
- The Eugene Bennett Scholarship for the Visual Arts provides a one time award for students enrolled in an undergraduate, or graduate, graphic arts program at an Oregon public college or university. Applicants must have a minimum 2.75 GPA, and awards are determined by portfolio submission.

- The Dorothy Campbell Memorial Scholarship is available to graduating female seniors of any Oregon High School. Applicants must have a minimum 2.75 GPA, and must have been a participant in their high school's golf team. Students must submit an essay describing their interest in the sport of golf. Awards are determined on the basis of academic merit, essay submission and financial need.
- The Ford  Opportunity  Scholarship is  supported  by  the  Ford  Family  Foundation,  and  provides  annual scholarship awards to undergraduate students pursuing a bachelor's degree at one of Oregon's public colleges or universities. Applicants must be enrolled full time, and must have a minimum 3.0 GPA. The scholarship is renewable as long as eligibility requirements are maintained.
- The Ford ReStart Scholarship is  also  supported by the Ford Family Foundation, and targets the needs of adult  students  25  years  of  age  or  older  who  are  heading  to  college  for  the  first  time.  Applicants  must  be pursuing a bachelor's degree at an Oregon public college. The award is renewable, but can not be combined with any other Ford Family sponsored scholarships.

These are just a few of the many scholarships administered through the Oregon Student Assistance Commission. Many more scholarships are available, and students are encouraged to consult the Oregon Student Assistance Commission's Scholarship Catalog [https://secure.osac.state.or.us/listScholarships.aspx (https://secure.osac.state.or.us/listScholarships.aspx)] for information on additional programs, and to download the necessary application forms.

The government of Oregon understands the importance, and value, of making college more accessible to its residents. Through the hard work of the Oregon Student Assistance Commission

(http://oregonstudentaid.gov/home.aspx), resident students of the Beaver State have access to some of the best grant and scholarship programs in the country.

## The State Of Nevada's College Aid

## Scholarships and Grants to Help You Acquire a

Degree

Nevada provides educational opportunities at a range of state colleges, universities and community colleges. Schools like College of Southern Nevada (http://www.csn.edu/),  Great Basin College, and Truckee Meadows Community College (http://www.tmcc.edu/) may not have household names, but wide-ranging degree pursuits are satisfied at these, and other Nevada institutions of higher education.

To support the efforts of needy state students, financial aid originates from a variety of public and private sector sources.  In addition to large-scale federal government assistance programs, Nevada students rely on statespecific resources (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm) to meet college expenses.  To uncover Nevada's financial aid riches, explore the Nevada State Treasurer's Office, the Nevada System of Higher Education (http://system.nevada.edu/Nshe/) and the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education.

## General Scholarships and Grants

One of the most popular Nevada scholarships is the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship

(https://nevadatreasurer.gov/millenniumscholarship.htm). This scholarship program is administered through the Nevada State Treasurer's Office, and made possible by the cooperative 1999 efforts of several State Government agencies, including the Nevada System of  Higher Education Board of Regents.  High school seniors with exceptional academic standing are encouraged to apply. Eligible candidates are entering approved four-year degree programs and are prepared to declare their academic majors. In many cases, the scholarship covers a large portion of each successful participant's total tuition costs. This program was developed to challenge Nevada students, and give them incentives to pursue competitive high school curricula that prepare them for the academic rigors of higher education.

Institutions that are eligible for Kenny C. Guinn Memorial Millennium Scholarships include these schools:

## The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education

(http://www.wiche.edu/) administers the Western Undergraduate Exchange Program, which accommodates educational flexibility for students who might otherwise be discouraged by the cost of non-

- Roseman University of Health Sciences (http://www.roseman.edu/types\_of\_aid)

- Great Basin College
- Western Nevada College

resident tuition at schools outside their native states. Generally, Nevada college students enrolling in other participating western states qualify for tuition reduction that lowers their total fees to rates only 50% higher than those enjoyed by residents of those states.

## Nevada State College System Grants and Scholarships

State-funded college systems, like Nevada's, administer state-backed financial aid programs that benefit students enrolled at state schools. A handful of college assistance programs are in-place to offset college expenses within the Nevada system.

The Nevada State Access Grant (http://nsc.nevada.edu/1412.asp)is a general award, disbursed to the neediest state applicants.  Because funding for the program is limited, early applicants maintain the greatest likelihood of landing grants.

Out-of-State Grant-in-Aid provides financial assistance for out of state students attending Nevada schools.  To qualify, submit the NSC Scholarship application and the Grant-in-Aid application.

- * Important notice:  The Regents Award Program is now known as the Regents Service Program. The initiative offers disadvantaged students the opportunity to work in community service jobs while still attending school. Requirements that qualify candidates include:  single parent household, age 22 or older, financially disadvantaged, and a lack of social, cultural or familial support, combined with a history of educational displacement.  Priority consideration for Nevada Regents Service Program (http://www.unlv.edu/finaid/workprograms/regents-service) is given to candidates who file FAFSA by February 1st.

## Specialized Scholarships and Grants

Like many other Western states, Nevada contains large rural regions that are typically considered medically under-served by many health-care professions. As a result, Nevada's Professional Student Exchange Program (http://wiche.edu/sep/psep/) offers incentives for students seeking education and training that is not available in Nevada. Eleven Western states participate in the program, which provides several advantages for enrolled students.  Program participants are given priority admissions consideration at some schools, and receive reduced tuition for studying certain fields.  For approved academic programs, tuition rates are drawn down to in-state levels for student exchange participants.  Some health care fields currently eligible for funding:

- Podiatry
- Occupational therapy
- Optometry
- Veterinary medicine
- Dentistry
- Physical therapy
- Others

Nevada's Health Care Access Program (http://www.health.nv.gov/NHAP.htm) takes steps to address shortages of health care professionals within the state's medically under-served territories and facilities. Grants are available for nursing students, physician assistants and physical therapists. Loan repayment programs are available for working nurses, dentists and mental health professionals. Successful applicants agree to work for no less than 2 years in designated Nevada health care facilities.

Additional nursing scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm), loan forgiveness and other financial opportunities for medical education (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/healthscience.htm) exist across the United States.

## Financial Aid In Colorado

## College Costing You a Bundle?

Colorado is well known for its natural wonders, healthy lifestyles and rugged individualism. It is also a state that is equally well known for its investment in education. Resident students of the Centennial State have access to some of the best colleges and universities in the nation. They also have access to one of the best resources for financial aid in the College In Colorado  (https://secure.collegeincolorado.org/Home/\_default.aspx) initiative.

## Supported by Colorado's Department of Education, the College in Colorado

(https://secure.collegeincolorado.org/Home/\_default.aspx) website provides resident students with vital information on the state's universities, colleges and vocational schools.

<!-- image -->

## General Scholarships and Grants

Students planning to attend one of Colorado's many colleges and universities will want to begin their search for scholarships and grants by filling out and submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is required for all federal and state sponsored student aid, and should be priority number one for all college-bound students. Once the FAFSA is submitted, and students have received their Student Aid Report (https://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), it's time to start considering financial aid possibilities.

## Scholarship And Grant Opportunities In New Mexico

## Get Paid for Being a Standout Student

Every state has their own government-sanctioned authority that is in charge of college financial aid for the region. The New Mexico Higher Education Department (http://hed.state.nm.us/) located centrally in Santa Fe plays that role for the state of New Mexico, administering its state-funded scholarships and grants. The state college and university system of New Mexico is comprised of eight public and seven private four-year schools, and nine two-year community colleges, technical or professional schools. The New Mexico Higher Education Department is your best bet as you navigate this sea of options, having a very easy-to-use and helpful website full of financial aid information, college statistics, and access to scholarships and grant applications.

New Mexico students with economic need have a number of state-funded scholarships and grants available to them. Of course, the first step you will want to take if interested in getting monies from the state whatsoever is filling out the

Federal Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) which can be submitted online. This one form will give you access to a huge number of different scholarships, grants, and even loans available to students of the state. We have listed below a variety of the different award opportunities you may be eligible for, depending on your intended major, family income, GPA, college of choice, and other factors.

## College Scholarships in New Mexico

<!-- image -->

## Lottery Success Scholarships

Legislative Lottery Success Scholarships (http://nmhed.sks.com/Lottery.aspx) provide thousands of New Mexico students with generous funding for their college educations. Program such as this prove the wild success of state lottery programs and give many students a chance at college who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford it. Eligible students must be state residents, enrolled in one of 25 public college campuses or universities in New Mexico and have a GPA of at least 2.5. 100% tuition funding is determined during the student's first semester out of high school and begins during the second semester. You may apply directly through the school.

## College Affordability Grant

More and more college students are falling under the heading of non-traditional. These students tend to be adults who have been displaced from higher education for any number of factors. Non-traditional students often face challenges in locating the necessary funding to return to college. In response to this problem, the state of New Mexico recently established the College Affordability Grant (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Grants.aspx) that offers the non-traditional student a financial leg-up, as well as any other type of student who is not eligible to receive other state scholarships or grants. The grant is for $1000/semester and can be applied for over eight semesters. Applicants must be able to prove financial need. Apply directly through the school and complete a FAFSA.

## New Mexico Student Incentive Grant

For financially disadvantaged students interested in attending one of New Mexico's public colleges or universities, or one of another half-dozen independent or technical institutions, students may qualify to receive funding between $200 and $2500 annually from the New Mexico Student Incentive Grant (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Grants.aspx). Students must be enrolled at least part-time and demonstrate significant financial need.

## Legislative Endowment Scholarship

The state Legislative Endowment Scholarship (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/LegisEndo.aspx) is one other option for economically disadvantaged students to defray the high cost of college. Eligible students must fill out the FAFSA and be attending a public college or university in the state. Award maximum is $2500 for a four-year college and $1000 for a two-year college. Students may attend full-time or part-time. Those who maintain their grades and set their standards high may be eligible to continue the scholarship during all the years their tuition is due.

## Student Choice Grant

New Mexico students considering attending the University of the Southwest or St. John's College, may qualify for the Student Choice Grant (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Grants.aspx). Eligible applicants must be able to prove dire economic need. Apply directly through the school and by filling out the FAFSA. Undergraduates receiving this award must be enrolled at least part-time in the school of their choice. Award amounts are determined by the school.

## New Mexico Scholars Program

Every state hopes to retain their most talented students in the hopes that if they study at home, they will become high achievers and leaders within their professions, in the long run helping to build a stronger state economy. In such hopes, the State of New Mexico administers the New Mexico Scholars program (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/NMScholar.aspx). Students must be state residents and interested in attending one of the state's public colleges or universities, or St. John's College or the College of the Southwest. Recipients may receive funding for full tuition, fees, and books, and this is renewable if high academic standards are maintained. Students must have graduated in the top 5% of their class to be eligible for this special scholarship.

## Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship

The Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) rewarded the highest academic achievers by state, but unfortunately the program did not receive any further funding as of 2012, and it has been suspended.

## Competitive Scholarship

Out of state academic achievers are also eligible for New Mexico scholarships. The Competitive Scholarship (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Comp.aspx) awards eligible non-residents small stipends and resident tuition if they attend a NM public institution. Out-of-state recipients of the Competitive Scholarship receive $100 a semester in addition to the advantage of only paying resident pricing. You may apply directly through the school for this unique program. GPA criteria will be considered.

## Vietnam Veteran's Scholarship

Vietnam Veterans may qualify for a tuition waiver at any of the state colleges or universities, and/or St. John's College and the College of the Southwest, through the Vietnam Veteran's Scholarship

(http://www.hed.state.nm.us/VET.aspx). The option is available to both undergraduate and graduate students, and will cover the costs of tuition, fees, and books at the college of their choice.

## Education Trust Board Pathways Scholarship

This one-time scholarship goes to the most financially disadvantaged students in New Mexico who are graduating high school and wish to attend a college either in New Mexico or in any other state. Students must have a 3.25 GPA at the time of graduation, be a first-time college freshman, and must file a FAFSA to be a recipient of the Education Trust Board Pathways Scholarship (http://hed.state.nm.us/ETB\_Scholar.aspx). See the New Mexico Higher Education Department for more information on this generous award.

## Specialized Studies Programs

For students pursuing teaching careers or a health profession, the State of New Mexico provides a number of 'loan-for-service' programs. Students participating in these programs are typically required to exchange work in an under-served or shortage area after graduation. This is a great plan for those who want a two-for-one deal of education and a career.

- New Mexico's Teacher Loan-for-Service Program (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Teach.aspx) provides attractive tuition  funding  for  those  undergraduate  or  graduate  level  teaching  students  who  are  willing  to  commit  to teaching in a state public school system following graduation. Eligible recipients must show both academic merit and financial need for funds. The amount awarded may be up to $4,000 per year. Apply by filling out the FAFSA  through  the  school.  If  you  are  interested  in  this  opportunity,  you  may  also  want  to  explore  other national teaching scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm).
- New Mexico students interested in pursuing a degree in nursing may explore the merits of the Nursing Loanfor-Service  Program  (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Nurse.aspx).  Eligible  students  must  be  attending  a  state college or university and willing to exchange tuition expenses for a specified length of time working as a nurse in an under-served area following graduation. Nursing students must also prove financial need and academic merit, and a whopping $12,000 a year is available to recipients. Apply by filling out the FAFSA directly through the school. See other national nursing scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm) if you are interested in the programs that other states offer that are similar.
- The Allied Health Professionals Loan-for-Service Program (http://hed.state.nm.us/Allied.aspx) provides tuition costs  to  those  in-state  students  pursuing  applicable  health  professions  at  a  state  college  or  university. Participants  must  agree  to  serve  an  area  with  high  need  upon  graduation.  Specialists  in  Dental  Hygiene, Respiratory Care, and Physical Therapy are particularly sought after. Up to $12,000 a year is available for this program,  and  students  may  apply  using  the  FAFSA  and  the  Loan-for-Service  application  available  on  the website.
- Medical students enrolled in the University of New Mexico's School of Medicine may be eligible for the Medical Loan-for-Service Program  (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/Medical.aspx). Medical students must  be state residents, show financial need as well as academic merit and be willing to practice in an underserved area of New Mexico following graduation. Up to $25,000 per year is generously available. See other national medical scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/medical-students.htm) if you are interested in other programs like this.
- The  Western  Interstate  Commission  on  Higher  Education  (WICHE)  Loan-for-Service  Professional  Exchange Program (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/WICHE.aspx) provides deserving students with a chance to study at graduate  programs  in  other  states  for  which  New  Mexico  may  not  have  a  viable  option.  Dentistry  and veterinary medicine, in particular, are the two fields that New Mexico lacks graduate education in, so students who wish to pursue these fields may choose an eligible graduate school in another state and pay only reduced tuition through this program.

## Financial Aid in New Mexico

As you can tell, New Mexico has a fully-stocked hub of opportunities for all of its students, no matter whether they are fully on track with a professional career or just getting started on the hunt for a major. The New Mexico Higher Education Department will be a great help to your search for funding, providing a financial aid calendar of events among other helpful tools. All financial aid details for these scholarships can be accessed in their entirety, with applications, at the department's website.

The Higher Education Department has information on a few of New Mexico's loan waiver programs, too, such as the Public Service Law Loan Repayment Program (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/LPR.aspx) and the John R. Justice Loan Repayment Programs (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/JRJ.aspx), which will pay some of your loans for you if you agree to service to the state.

## Scholarships And Grants In Maine

## Find Financial Assistance for Your Education

The state of Maine provides a variety of grants, scholarships and loan forgiveness programs designed to make college more accessible for its resident students. These programs are funded by the state, and are administered by the Finance Authority of Maine (http://www.famemaine.com/index.aspx) (FAME). The state legislature of Maine has developed these financial aid programs to encourage more residents to attend college, and ultimately, to retain talented graduates within the state's workforce. Many of Maine's scholarships and loan forgiveness programs are career specific, encouraging students to pursue degrees and careers in high demand fields such as medicine and veterinary science.

As with all state supported financial aid for college students, programs are subject to change according to new legislation and the availability of funds.

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any state funded financial aid, students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid

(http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine a student's eligibility for any Federal or state sponsored grants and scholarships, as well as for loans and loan forgiveness programs. The information students supply on their FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities to evaluate an applicant's eligibility for any campus-based financial aid. Collegebound students in Maine should make the FAFSA priority number one in their search for student aid.

## General Financial Aid

Maine offers three general financial aid programs for its resident students. These programs are awarded on the basis of need, and provide financial assistance to students who are enrolled at any accredited state

<!-- image -->

supported college or university. Interested students should visit the FAME

(http://www.famemaine.com/files/Pages/education/students\_and\_families/Maine\_Financial\_Aid.aspx) website for specific details on these programs, and for information on how to apply for these and other financial aid opportunities.

- The State of Main Grant Program -  This  is  a  need-based  grant  available  to  undergraduate  students  in Maine  who  are  enrolled,  or  are  preparing  to  enroll,  in  an  accredited  state  college  or  university.  Students should apply through their college of attendance. The maximum award amount is $1000 per academic year. Students may reapply for the grant every year they meet the eligibility requirements.
- The Maine Tuition Waiver (Foster Care) The state of Maine provides full tuition waivers for students who were in the foster care system of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services at the time of their high  school  graduation.  Eligible  students  must  be  enrolled,  or  preparing  to  enroll,  in  a  degree  granting program at a state college or university. 30 waivers are granted each year, and are awarded on a first come, first served basis.
- The Maine Tuition Waiver (Public Servant) - Like the tuition waiver for foster care children, this program provides  a  full  tuition  award  for  the  dependent  children  of  police  officers,  firefighters  and  other  first responders  who  have  been  killed  in  the  line  of  duty.  Students  must  attend  an  accredited  state  supported college or university. There is no limit to the number of waivers which may be issued each year.

## Career-Specific Financial Aid

Like many states across the country, Maine is experiencing critical shortages in certain high demand professions. To help address the constant need for educators, health professionals and public defenders Maine has developed a number of loans and loan forgiveness programs designed to encourage students to pursue careers in these fields. These are all award-for-service programs, and students will be expected to complete a service contract within the state in order to receive funding. Interested students will find more information on these programs at the FAME (http://www.famemaine.com/files/Pages/education/students\_and\_families/Maine\_Financial\_Aid.aspx) website.

The following career-specific financial aid programs are offered by the state of Maine for its resident students.

- The Educators for Maine Program - Educators for Maine is a forgivable loan program for students pursuing degrees and careers in teaching, speech pathology and child care. Eligibility is strictly determined on the basis of merit, and applicants will be required to submit a 500 word essay which will be reviewed for grammar, style and content. Undergraduate students may receive up to $3000 per year in forgivable loans, while graduate students  are  eligible  to  receive  up  to  $2000  per  year.  Recipients  must  agree  to  a  predetermined  term  of service  working  within  the  state  as  a  teacher  or  child  care  provider.  Students  who  fail  to  discharge  their service contract will be required to repay the loan in full.
- Doctors for Maine's Future Scholarship - This program provides valuable scholarships to students who are enrolled in an approved medical school program within the state. Applicants must be legal residents of Maine, and  must  have  received  a  baccalaureate  degree  from  an  accredited  state  four-year  college  or  university. Eligible  candidates  will  receive  a  scholarship  for  up  to  50%  of  their  total  annual  tuition  costs,  or  $25,000, whichever is less. The scholarship is renewable for up to four years.
- The Maine Dental Education Loan Program - This is a forgivable loan program designed to encourage and support students pursuing post-graduate studies in dentistry. Eligible applicants may receive up to $20,000 per  year  in  forgivable  loans,  not  to  exceed  a  four  year  aggregate  of  $80,000.  Participants  in  the  Dental Education Loan Program must agree to provide primary care at an eligible dental care facility in an underserved community in Maine.
- The Maine Health Professionals Loan Program - This is a need-based low interest loan program designed to  assist  students  who  are  pursuing  degrees  and  careers  in  medicine,  dentistry  and  veterinary  science. Applicants  must  be  residents  of  Maine,  and  must  be  enrolled  in  an  accredited  program  of  allopathic, osteopathic,  veterinary  medicine,  or  dentistry  at  an  approved  state  medical  school.  Eligible  students  may borrow up to $25,000 annually for no more than four years.
- The  Maine  Veterinary  Medicine  Loan  Program  This  is  a  need-based  forgivable  loan  program  for students pursuing a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. To be eligible, students must be residents of Maine, must  be  enrolled  in  an  approved  Veterinary  School  with  the  intention  of  practicing  livestock  veterinary medicine in an area of the state suffering a shortage of qualified veterinarians. Students may borrow up to $25,000 annually, for a maximum of four years. Full or partial loan forgiveness will be available to graduates who fulfill a service contract with the state.
- The John R. Justice Grant Program - This program provides loan repayment assistance to public defenders and state prosecutors who agree to work within the state for a minimum of three years. Applicants must be full  time  employees of the state or local government, and funds can be applied to any outstanding Federal loans. The maximum award amount is $2400.

The state of Maine is determined to help its residents achieve their post-secondary educational goals. By offering grants, scholarships and loan forgiveness programs, they hope to encourage more students to pursue a college education.

## Scholarships And Grants From Idaho

## Looking for Financial Aid?

Boise State (http://www.boisestate.edu/), University of Idaho and Brigham Young University (http://www.byui.edu/) are only a few of the reputable institutions of higher education located in Idaho. For motivated state college students, The Idaho Board of Education (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/) presents a number of state-funded scholarships and grants.

Preliminary dates and requirements are listed on their site here (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/scholarship\_jump.asp).

General aid initiatives benefit wide-ranging state applicants, while other programs focus assistance efforts on particular groups, like out-of-state students, minorities, education majors and aspiring health care professionals.

## General Scholarships and Grants

The Idaho Governor's Cup (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/gov\_cup.asp) program encourages Idaho's high school students to tackle their pre-college curriculum in anticipation of in-state college careers. The scholarship also recognizes students who have had active histories in community programs and volunteer activities. The Idaho Governor's Cup requires a 2.8 GPA for participation. Students may pursue either an academic track, or a technical one, which influences eligibility requirements and scholarship amounts. Awards are in the $3000 range.

Idaho Opportunity scholarship (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/opportunity.asp) is a need-based award for Idaho residents who graduated from an Idaho high school and current college students with at least a 3.0 GPA.

The Tschudy Family Scholarship (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/tschudy.asp) is unique to Idaho. The program is available to eligible Idaho residents who have graduated from Emmett High School. Recipients earn $2500 each, for education at these participating universities: Idaho State University, Boise State University, Lewis-Clark State College, or the University of Idaho. Scholarships are renewable for up to five years of undergraduate tuition assistance, and for two years of graduate eligibility.

## Idaho's Armed Forces / Public Safety Officer Dependent Scholarship

(http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/freedom.asp) honors public safety personnel, veterans killed or wounded in action, and POWs imprisoned during 'armed conflict,' by providing full tuition for their children. In order to receive the full benefits of the scholarship, students must agree to attend an Idaho state college or university. The awards include tuition waivers for state schools, and stipends of $500/semester to be applied to ancillary expenses like books and classroom supplies. Housing allowances and campus meal programs are also provided for qualified participants.

## Specialized Study Scholarships and Grants

Like many other states, Idaho has identified areas that are underserved by certain vocations. These areas, experiencing critical shortages of nurses, medical professionals and teachers, present unique financial aid opportunities for Idaho's college students. For students who choose certain academic majors, and agree to certain conditions, the state offers a few student assistance programs that pay tuition, or exchange loan repayment for work.

Teachers and nurses are recruited using the Education Incentive Loan Forgiveness Program

<!-- image -->

(http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/st\_loan\_forgive.asp). In exchange for professional work in designated, under-served areas, Idaho students qualify for full or partial repayment or forgiveness of college tuition expenses. Full-time students qualify by agreeing to work for at least two-years in particular employment roles within the state of Idaho.

The Idaho State Board of Education has partnered with a number of other western colleges and universities to offer Medicine/Veterinary/Dentistry Scholarships

(http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/public\_col\_univ/medicine.asp). Idaho students pursuing medicine, dentistry or veterinary medicine have the opportunity to study out of state, in high-quality programs, for less than full tuition rates. By joining forces with Washington, Utah, Wyoming and other states, Idaho provides reasonable tuition options for future medical professionals.

## Recently Discontinued Programs

The below programs have been discontinued , but the information is archived in case you may have heard about these programs from other sites &amp; were researching their current status.

Many Idaho students qualify for a few hundred scholarship dollars disbursed through the Robert R. Lee Promise Category B Scholarship (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/promiseb.asp) Program. Eligible students have cumulative GPA of at least 2.5, and complete 12 or more college credit hours each semester. Applicants under 22 yrs of age are eligible for the $300 award during each of their four years of college.

The Robert R. Lee Promise Category A Scholarship (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/promise\_a.asp) (aka State of Idaho Scholarship) is offered to Idaho students, based on academic or technical merit. These $3000 scholarships are available to residents enrolled full-time at Idaho state-funded colleges and universities. Academic students are required to maintain a 3.5 GPA, while technical students need a 2.8 GPA, to qualify. Scholarships are applied to tuition expenses at these participating institution: Lewis-Clark State College, College of Southern Idaho, Eastern Idaho Technical College, College of Western Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University, Brigham Young University-Idaho, Northwest Nazarene University, North Idaho College, The College of Idaho, or University of Idaho.

Federally funded Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) reward academic excellence, going to top performers from all states. A certain number of honors-level high school seniors, from each state, are chosen by a board of professional educators to receive honors scholarships

each year. Recipients earn around $1500 for their initial awards, and the scholarships are renewable. Byrd Scholars attend college full-time, in university degree programs of their choice. Military academies are excluded from participating, and qualified applicants are already accepted into university programs when they apply.

Designed to attract out of state students to Idaho colleges and universities, the Leveraging Educational Assistance State Partnership (http://cwidaho.cc/scholarship/leveraging-educational-assistance-state-partnershipleap-scholarship) Program (LEAP) was originally called the Idaho State Student Incentive Grant. Out-of-state students who can prove serious financial need qualify for grants valued at up to up $5000 each. LEAP funds are used to help cover tuition expenses at Idaho state colleges and universities.

Idaho's Minority/At Risk Student Scholarship (http://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/scholarship/minority.asp) Program recognizes students whose college education is impacted by a variety of conditions, including: Economic disadvantage, cultural/social challenges and familial support issues. Students assisted by the program include applicants who are disabled, minorities, first generation college students, as well migrant laborers and their dependents. Eligible students must be U.S. and Idaho citizens and residents, and graduates of an Idaho high school. Scholarships are worth up to $3000 per academic year, for up to four years.

The following grants and scholarships are among the more notable programs being offered to resident students from the great state of Texas.

The College for All Texans (http://www.collegefortexans.com/) website also provides useful links to many regional and national organizations that offer scholarships and grants applicable to students in Texas. The few following examples will demonstrate the wide range of financial aid possibilities open to students of the Lone Star state who have chosen a specific career path.

- Scholarships for Women in Engineering -The Society of Women Engineers (http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/index.php/scholarships#activePanels) awards more than 180 annual  scholarships  to  eligible  students  in  the  United  States  and  Mexico.

This  government  funded  program  is designed to improve the quality, and availability, of teachers in rural and under-served areas of the country. Grants are available to resident students of Texas who agree to take a teaching position in a state  facility or community experiencing a critical shortage of qualified teachers.

## Grants and Scholarships for Non-Resident Students

In an effort to draw the best and brightest to their colleges and universities, Texas offers a number of grants and scholarships to non-resident students who are planning to attend school at one of the state's institutes of higher learning. These grants and scholarships are highly competitive, and students are advised to apply early for consideration. Once again, the College for All Texans  (http://www.collegefortexans.com/) website is a prime source for information on these, and other, financial aid programs.

Non-resident students planning to attend a Texas college or university may be interested in the following examples of financial aid programs for which they may be eligible.

- The Texas Public Education Grant (http://www.collegeforalltexans.com/apps/financialaid/tofa2.cfm?ID=406) is open to resident and non-resident students who are attending an accredited, not-for-profit, Texas university or college. The grant is open to students who can demonstrate the requisite level of financial need. Awards are determined by the applicants financial status, as well as academic achievement.
- The Texas Tuition Equalization Grant Program (http://www.collegeforalltexans.com/apps/financialaid/tofa2.cfm?ID=534)  is  open  to  all  Texas  residents,  as well as  to  non-resident  National  Merit  Award  (http://www.nationalmerit.org/)  finalists.  Students  must demonstrate the requisite level of financial need, and be enrolled at a participating Texas university or college. The maximum award amount is $3500, though students with an Expected Family Contribution (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm) of less than $1000 may be eligible for additional funds.
- The  National  Health  Service  Corps  (http://nhsc.hrsa.gov/)  offers  scholarships,  grants  and  loan  repayment programs  for  medical  students  attending  one  of  Texas'  colleges  or  universities.

Financial aid amounts are determined by financial need, as well as academic merit.

These are only a few of the financial aid programs available to college-bound students in Texas. Resident and non-resident students planning to attend one of Texas' colleges, universities or technical schools will also find that most institutions offer their own financial aid programs. Many of these programs will be merit-based, though some will be determined on the basis of financial need. Students are encouraged to consult the financial aid department at the school of their choice for information on available programs.

## College Funding In Kansas

## Programs to Help You Pay for Your Education

Kansas continues its strong academic tradition at noted state schools like Bethel College (http://www.bethelks.edu/), University of Kansas, Kansas State (http://www.k-state.edu/), Wichita State and others.  The Kansas State university system is comprised of six state university campuses, one municipal university, 19 community colleges and nearly a dozen technical institutions. To support access to higher education among state residents, the Kansas Board Of Regents administers a formidable stable of state-funded scholarships and grants.

Kansas college students earn state-backed financial aid for all levels of study; rewarding them for outstanding academic performance and underwriting higher education expenses for financially challenged applicants.  Degree candidates seeking student assistance to supplement federal aid

(https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm) packages are well served by the following Kansas resources.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Kansas Comprehensive Grants make college education affordable for financially disadvantaged students. Qualified students are enrolled at eighteen private colleges throughout the state, as well as those attending the six state universities. Legislative action determines funding for the program, which distributes awards ranging in value

from $100 to $3000.  As with other Board of Regents assistance, financial need is determined using FAFSA calculations (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/),  so the Free Application for Federal Student Aid is square-one for financially needy Kansas college students.

## Priority FAFSA filing deadline for Kansas student assistance is April 1st.

Vocational students who are Kansas state residents qualify for unique financial assistance from the Vocational Educational Scholarship Program. Important Note: The program has been renamed the Career Technical Workforce Grant . Funding is provided for Kansas residents attending eligible institutions of higher education and enrolled in approved technical programs Grants are designed for schools that issue state-designated certificates and associate's degrees in high-need fields, and those fields that serve critical industries.  For more information on how this scholarships is evolving, consult your high school guidance counselor, college financial aid office or visit: http://www.kansasregents.org/scholarships\_and\_grants (http://www.kansasregents.org/scholarships\_and\_grants)

## Priority application deadline for Workforce Grants falls on May 1st annually.

## Academically talented students benefit from the Kansas Scholars Program

(http://www.kansasregents.org/kansas\_scholars\_program). Outstanding students who have completed the 'regents approved curriculum' and who are enrolled at state colleges or universities qualify to receive up to $1000 per academic year. Needy applicants from the top 20-40% of their high school classes are invited to apply.  Superior ACT scores and above average GPA required, and qualified candidates must adhere strictly to the state scholars curriculum.

For the most academically talented high school graduates, the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) awards educational funding for degree pursuits in any state. Though it is not a state-specific initiative, the program assists qualified Kansas students for up to four years - or the length of time it takes to complete the required undergraduate degree program. Eligible students are honors-level high school seniors who possess top ACT scores and reside at the tops of their classes. Participating students are nominated and chosen by school officials.

Graduate level scholars, who are past recipients of such respected scholarships as the Fulbright (http://www.cies.org/about\_fulb.htm), Rhodes (http://www.rhodesscholar.org/), Marshall, Madison, Truman (http://www.truman.gov/) and Mellon, may receive additional scholarships from the State of Kansas. The Distinguished Scholars Program is designed as an incentive to keep talented academic professionals working, studying and living in Kansas.  Qualified applicants earn tuition reimbursement for in-state graduate studies.

The James B. Pearson Fellowship is made available for the purpose of educating students with a global perspective.  The study-abroad incentive emphasizes graduate pursuits that include travel. Student residents of Kansas currently attending state colleges or universities qualify for as much as $2200 each.

Minority students - African American, Hispanic (https://www.collegescholarships.org/minority2.htm), Native Alaskan or Native American, and Asian (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/asian.htm) - qualify for Kansas Ethnic Minority Scholarships. Academically motivated minority students compete for educational funding that is earned with high GPAs and ACT scores, as well as documented participation in a regents-approved 'scholars curriculum.' Full-time undergraduate students, with the above qualifications, who prove financial need qualify for up to $1800 each academic year. Additional minority scholarships (https://www.collegescholarships.org/other-minority-scholarships.htm) opportunities originate from a variety of sources.

State-funded tuition waivers are available for students who have been in foster care and for dependents of public safety officers killed in the line of duty.

## Specialized Studies Scholarships and Grants

Like many other states, Kansas is actively recruiting educators, nurses and other allied health professionals (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/health-science.htm). Teachers and health care providers are in short supply overall, but some areas are critically under-served.  Students willing to trade service agreements in high-need professions, enjoy college tuition abatement and forgiveness that can amount to free higher education.

Teaching students benefit from these scholarships and grants:

- The Kansas Teacher Service Scholarship is designed as an incentive to lure academically talented students into teaching professions . The program awards students, undergraduate or graduate level, up to $5000 per academic year until certification is received. Adherence to the college preparatory program, as outline by the state  Board  of  Regents,  as  well  as  superior  GPA  performance  is  required  for  participation.  In  exchange  for scholarships, students must agree to teach in the state public school system following graduation.  Service commitments are matched year-for-year with the period of time each student receives assistance.
- Special Education teachers continue to be in short supply. Qualified students may be eligible for the Special Education  Teachers  Service  Scholarship.  This  is  a  graduate  level  program  that  offers  tuition  incentives  to working teachers who hold  Bachelor's degrees, and are receiving specialized instruction related to special education. Recipients agree to work in the Kansas public school system as special education teachers. Additional education scholarships are listed here (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/teaching-students.htm).

Students pursuing certification in health professions such as nursing, dentistry, osteopathic medicine and optometry may qualify for one of the following unique Kansas financial aid programs:

- Nursing students benefit from Kansas' Nursing Scholarship Program, which offers funding to students pursuing registered nursing credentials and licensed practical nurse certification. Many of the scholarships are awarded to  students  willing  to  trade  service  commitments  for  tuition  reimbursement.    Rural  facilities  and  medically under-served  regions  draw  qualified  personnel  from  Kansas  recruitment  programs  supporting  medical education. Additional nursing school resources  (https://www.collegescholarships.org/nursing.htm)provide funding from a range of sources.
- The  Dental  Education  Opportunities  Program  specifically  levels  assistance  toward  dental  students  enrolled at the University of Missouri - Kansas City.  The initiative contributes to out-of-state tuition costs, by making up the difference between in-state and out-of-state rates.
- The  Kansas  Optometry  Service  Scholarship  and  the  Kansas  Osteopathic  Medical  Service  Scholarship address shortages of qualified, specialized medical professionals practicing in rural and under-served areas of Kansas.  In  exchange  for  college  financial  assistance,  scholarship  recipients  agree  to  practice  professionally within certain high-needs areas of the state. Additional health and medical career opportunities (https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/health-science.htm) draw attention from a variety of scholarship sources.

## College Funding From The State Of Massachusetts

## Include These Sources in Your Financial Aid Search

The State of Massachusetts boasts a rich educational tradition with a public college and university system comprised of:  The University of Massachusetts - with campuses in Boston, Amhers (http://www.umass.edu/)t, Lowell, Dartmouth and Worcester, State University campuses like Bridgewater (http://www.bridgew.edu/), Fitchburg, Salem and Westfield, and dozens of community colleges across the state.

The Massachusetts Department of Higher Education (http://www.mass.edu/) administers state-funded grants and scholarships designed to increase access to higher education for Massachusetts students. Several initiatives offer various forms, and levels, of aid that address the needs of particular student groups.

<!-- image -->

## Massachusetts Programs for College Students

Massachusetts commitment to education is apparent in efforts like The Vision Project (http://www.mass.edu/visionproject/timetolead.asp), which puts a spot light on state higher education.  A recent report from the Project, Time to Lead , compares Massachusetts higher education outcomes with other states' and strives to outline ways to improve educational opportunities for state college students.

Achieving The Dream (http://www.achievingthedream.org/) is a national effort aimed at increasing educational access among under-represented student groups.  In Massachusetts, four Community Colleges participate in the program, which puts forth these goals:

- Help under-served students complete courses
- Move remedial students into classes that earn degree credits
- Foster completion of 'gatekeeper' courses
- Facilitate continuous enrollment
- Increase the number of students within the state earning degrees and certificates

Participating State Community Colleges:  Bunker Hill, Northern Essex (http://www.necc.mass.edu/), Roxbury, and Springfield Technical (http://www.stcc.edu/).  Funding for the program is supplemented by local benefactors, including the Boston and Davis Foundations.

The College Access Challenge Grant (http://www.mass.edu/currentinit/currentinitcacg.asp) is a federally funded initiative conceived to stimulate partnerships between educational agencies at all levels of government and philanthropic organizations dedicated to educational causes.  Working with federal-backing, partners target significant financial hardship, providing college funding for those at, or below, the poverty level.

Commonwealth Dual Enrollment Program (http://www.mass.edu/currentinit/currentinitdualenrollment.asp) is a unique Massachusetts initiative that allows state high school students to take college courses, free of charge. Credits apply to each student's high school and college course requirements.  Program participants typically enjoy an 80% completion rate and carry GPAs in excess of 3.0.

The Performance Bonus Grant  (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=performanceBonus)is designed to increase access for Massachusetts' students who would not otherwise be financially prepared to pursue higher education. Eligible students are the most economically challenged, but also exhibit academic motivation.

Funding for this program is currently suspended.  This listing is maintained as a historical reference, in case the State of Massachusetts re-launches the initiative.

MASSGrant (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=massGrant)is the state's flagship need-based award program. Students who are state residents enrolled in undergraduate education, including four-year, two-year and technical/certificate programs, are eligible for MASSGrants.  Additional eligibility requirements for MassGrant applicants:

- Expected Family Contribution below $5000
- United States citizen
- Massachusetts resident
- Full-time student
- Have not earned a bachelor's degree previously
- Registered with Selective Service
- Not in default on any prior student loans
- Exhibit financial need, based on FAFSA data
- Maintain satisfactory academic progress while receiving aid

Award amounts vary according to each applicant's EFC and the financial requirements present at the school of attendance; however, qualified applicants may receive up to $2300 per academic year.

Recognizing demographic shifts, and college enrollment trends that have more students than ever attending parttime, the State of Massachusetts administers a grant program that specifically targets the needs of working adults and part-time, non-traditional students. The Massachusetts Part-Time Grant Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=partTimeGrant)is a less-than-full-time alternative to MASSGrants, which carries many of the same eligibility requirements.  The need-based program uses FAFSA data to award amounts dependent on the type of college and program each candidate is enrolled in.

As colleges and universities craft financial aid packages for their neediest applicants, they draw on an important Massachusetts resource called Need-Based Tuition Waivers (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=needbasedwaiver).  Qualified applicants benefit from a program committed to an even playing field for Massachusetts college students.  The program strives to keep financial aid opportunities on pace with rising college costs, and works with individual campuses to provide supplemental funding to the students who need it most.

A unique state initiative, The Paul Tsongas Scholarship (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=tsongasscholarship), provides assistance for the cream of the academic crop. Massachusetts students who graduate high school in 3 years, with 3.75 GPAs and top SAT scores qualify for waivers of tuition and fees at

state universities. Few students manage this feat, but the accomplishment is rewarded with full tuition abatement at fine Massachusetts state colleges and universities.

Class valedictorians listen up: You may qualify for scholarships that cover full tuition costs at public colleges and universities in Massachusetts.  Use your class ranking to land valuable recognition from the Valedictorian Program Tuition Waiver (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=valedictorianWaiver).

The Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarships (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/index.html) awards federallybacked scholarships to the most academically talented applicants. These highly visible annual honors offer $1500 each, to hundreds of students from every state. Eligibility is based on class rank, GPA and ACT/SAT scores. Students must be enrolled in four-year college or university programs, with the exception of military academy programs.

Outstanding junior and senior high school students with an aptitude for Math or English may be eligible for either the Stanley Koplick Certificate of Mastery Tuition Waiver (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=koplikwaiver) or the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship.  Rural applicants qualify for Agnes M. Lindsay Scholarships.

Veterans, minorities, senior citizens and other socially and financially disadvantaged/non-traditional students qualify for tuition waivers through the Categorical Tuition Waiver Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=categoricalWaiver). Qualified applicants must be enrolling at public institutions.

Dependents of Law Enforcement personnel, Firefighters, Public Safety Officers and other eligible public servants killed while performing in official capacities, may qualify for state tuition waivers through the Public Service Grant Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=publicServiceGrant). Qualified applicants must be enrolled at Massachusetts public institutions.

The Foster Child Grant Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=fosterchild) is funded by Massachusetts State Government to support students who have participated in the state's foster care system for a certain length of time. Applicants with appropriate financial need qualify for as much as $6000 each, per academic year.

## Specialized Studies Programs

Special incentives reward students for choosing particular educational paths.  Professions like nursing and teaching need well-trained college graduates to fill their ranks, so financial aid is offered to those who enroll in appropriate college programs.

## The CommonWealth Futures Grant Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?

page=commonwealthFutures) was designed to encourage students to major in 'subject shortage areas,' such as engineering, math, science and other tech-heavy disciplines.  Unfortunately, this program is no longer funded.

Nurses are at critical shortage levels in some areas of the country, so state-funded scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs are in place to assist students who complete degree programs and work in designated facilities. Massachusetts Gilbert Matching Student Grant Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=gilbert) provides for nursing majors at certain state schools.

A recent addition to the scope of Massachusetts' teacher incentive programs, the Paraprofessional Teacher Preparation Grant (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp?page=paraprofessional) supports individuals who have been serving in support/instructional capacities at public schools, but have lacked financial resources necessary to continue on to four-year teaching degree and certification programs.

The Tomorrow's Teachers Scholarship Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=tomTeachersScholarship) awards scholarships to academically talented high school graduates who are pursuing teaching credentials.  Successful applicants are enrolled in four-year college and university programs in Massachusetts, and stand willing to exchange tuition concessions for service following graduation.  In addition, childcare professionals pursuing degrees in Early Childhood Education are eligible to apply for assistance provided through the Early Childhood Educators' Scholarship Program (http://www.osfa.mass.edu/default.asp? page=ecescholarship).

## Scholarships And Grants In Tennessee

## See if You Fit the Requirements

Most states offer some level of financial assistance for their college-bound residents. Scholarships and grants are routinely sponsored by state governments, and financed with state revenues. Like many of its sister states, Tennessee has a state lottery which it uses to fund a variety of post-secondary financial aid programs for its resident students. State proceeds from this lottery are used to finance the wide range of scholarships, grants and loan-forgiveness programs administered by the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation (http://www.tn.gov/collegepays/). Since their inception, these state sponsored financial aid programs have made a college education more accessible to thousands of students in the Volunteer State.

<!-- image -->

## The FAFSA

All Federal and state sponsored financial aid for college-bound students begins with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). Every college-bound student pursuing government funded scholarships, grants or loan-forgiveness programs must first fill out and submit the FAFSA. The information students supply on their FAFSA application is used to determine the level of financial assistance for which they are eligible. All students preparing for college should make the FAFSA application their first priority.

## General Scholarships and Grants for Tennessee Students

Resident students in the state of Tennessee have access to some of the best scholarship and grant programs in the country. The programs administered by the Tennessee Student Assistance Corporation are a mixture of needbased grants and merit-based scholarships. These programs are available to current residents of Tennessee who have graduated high school, or who have completed their GED. Students applying for any of these state supported grants and scholarships must be enrolled, or preparing to enroll, at one of Tennessee's state colleges or universities.

The following sample of financial aid programs supported by the state of Tennessee will give students a good idea of the wide range of college funding that is available.

- The Tennessee Student Assistance Award (http://www.tn.gov/collegepays/mon\_college/tsa\_award.htm) provides non-repayable financial aid to low-income students who are enrolled, or are preparing to enroll, in an undergraduate program at a state college or university. To be eligible students must be Tennessee residents, and must have an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) of $2100 or less. Grant amounts vary, and are awarded on a first come, first served basis.
- The Tennessee Hope Access Grant (http://www.tn.gov/collegepays/mon\_college/hope\_grant.htm) is available to high school graduates with a minimum 2.75 GPA and an SAT score that falls between 860 and 970. To be eligible students must have an annual family income of no more than $36,000. Applicants must be enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in a state 4 year college or university. Award amounts currently stand at $1375 and are non-renewable.

## Minnesota's College Financial Aid Programs

## Don't Spend a Fortune for School

Minnesota provides a full range of financial aid opportunities for its resident students. The Minnesota legislature understands that a well educated populace is one of the pillars of a thriving economy, and so has developed a number of scholarships, grants and loan forgiveness programs designed to help students achieve their college ambitions. These valuable financial aid programs are administered by the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/) through its interactive Get Ready For College

(http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/) website. Resident college-bound students in the North Star State will want to take advantage of the wide variety of financial aid programs available to them at the state level.

## The FAFSA

Before beginning any search for college financial aid, students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/), or FAFSA. The information students supply on their FAFSA application is used to determine the level of Federal and state financial aid for which they are eligible. After the FAFSA has been submitted, students will receive their personalized Student Aid Report

(http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which will outline the types and amounts of financial aid for which the student may apply. The FAFSA is required for all Federal and state financial aid programs. It is also used by most college, banks and independent scholarship and grant advisory boards to determine a student's eligibility for financial aid. The FAFSA should be every college-bound students first priority.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Minnesota offers its residents a variety of general education scholarships and grants designed to help make college more accessible and more affordable. These programs are not linked to any particular course of study, and may take the form of merit-based scholarships or need-based grants.

The following general scholarships and grants are currently available to the resident college-bound students of Minnesota.

- The  Public  Safety  Officer's  Survival  Grant  (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm?pageID=145&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=8cae44ce26b4a6c5723347686f4ae068b014c9eb) provides financial assistance to the dependent children and spouses of public safety officers who have been killed in the line of duty.

## Aid for Student with Special Circumstances

Minnesota's state government also makes provisions for students in special circumstances. These programs are designed to help students suffering specific hardship find the money they need to complete a college education.

The following programs offer financial assistance to students in special circumstances who may not otherwise be able to afford college.

- The Minnesota Veterans' Dependents Assistance Program (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm? pageID=159&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=667386d1871635b15c5401f128f25822a563dbcb) provides financial aid for  college  to  the  dependents  of  persons  who  have  been  designated  as  Missing  In  Action,  or  who  are considered  Prisoners  of  War.  Eligible  students  must  be  enrolled  at  a  state  college  or  university.  Maximum award amounts are $250 per academic year.

Strictly speaking this is not an education grant. The intention is to make it easier for students with children to remain in college and complete their degrees. The award amount is determined by the number of people in the student's household, the number of day care hours required to cover college attendance and work schedules, and the income of the applicant. The maximum award amount is $2800 for each eligible child per academic year.
- The  Public  Safety  Officer's  Survival  Grant  (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm?pageID=145&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=8cae44ce26b4a6c5723347686f4ae068b014c9eb) provides financial assistance to the dependent  children  and  spouses  of  public  safety  officers  who  have  been  killed  in  the  line  of  duty.  To  be eligible, students must be enrolled in an undergraduate, graduate or certification program at a state college or university. The annual maximum awards are $10,488 for a student enrolled at a 4 year university, and $5,808 for students enrolled in a 2 year community college.

## Specialized Studies Grants and Scholarships

In addition to scholarships and grants, Minnesota's state government also sponsors a variety of programs designed to provide financial assistance to students who are pursuing careers in specific high demand professions. While not strictly grants or scholarships, these award-for-service programs offer loan forgiveness to students who agree to take up positions within the state, working at their chosen profession, in designated critical shortage facilities and communities.

The following financial aid programs are available to resident students pursuing specific careers in the state of Minnesota.

- The Federal John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/gPg.cfm? pageID=1939&amp;1534-D83A\_1933715A=5b8137cac6e37c42e60a45144f17e4638653f007) is designed to address the state's need for full time public defenders and public criminal prosecutors. Law school graduates who have passed the state bar may be eligible to have a portion of their outstanding school loans paid by the state  in  exchange  for  an  agreement  to  serve  as  a  public  defender  or  prosecutor  within  the  state  for  a minimum of three years. The amount of repayment may not exceed $4000 per year of the service agreement.
- The Minnesota Department of Health (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/orhpc/funding/) offers a variety of loan forgiveness programs and grants for state residents who are pursuing careers in certain high demand medical professions. These award-for-service programs offer substantial financial assistance to students who are pursuing careers as nurses, primary care physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners. In exchange for grant  money,  and/or  loan  repayment  funds,  students  must  agree  to  serve  in  a  professional  capacity  at  a designated  critical  need  facility  in  either  an  urban  or  rural  community.  Award  amounts  are  determined  by financial  need,  course  of  study,  professional  certification  and  licensing,  and  term  of  service.  Programs  are available for the following healthcare professions:
- Rural and urban Physicians
- Nurse Practitioners
- Nurses
- Faculty Nurses and Nursing Administration
- Pharmacists
- Dentistry

Resident college-bound students in Minnesota have access to some of the most extensive, and valuable, financial aid programs in the country. Whether pursuing a general degree, or working towards certification in a high demand medical or legal profession, Minnesota's residents are well positioned to find the financial assistance they need to make their college dreams a reality. Minnesota residents are encouraged to visit the state's Get Ready for College (http://www.getreadyforcollege.org/) website for more information on financial aid programs, saving for college and navigating the state's higher education system. Students will also find valuable information on testing procedures and application processes at all of Minnesota's state colleges and universities.

## Rhode Island Scholarships And Grants

## Get Big Funding in the Smallest State

Rhode Island may be one of the smaller states in the Union, but it is just as interested in providing educational opportunities for its residents as its larger counterparts. In order to make college more accessible, the state legislature of Rhoda Island has developed a number of grants and scholarships designed to help its resident students pay for their college education. These programs are funded by the state, and are administered by the Rhode Island Higher Education Assistance Authority (http://www.riheaa.org/).

Like all state supported financial aid for college, these scholarships and grants are only available to legal residents of Rhode Island who are enrolled, or preparing to enroll, in a public college or university within the state. College-bound students in Rhode Island who are struggling to meet the rising costs of a post-secondary education should make a point of investigating the financial aid programs offered by their state government.

Before applying for any state supported financial aid for college, students need to fill out and submit their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used by both Federal and state governments to determine a student's eligibility for any available financial assistance for college. The information provided on the student's FAFSA is also used by most colleges and universities, as well as independent scholarship and grant sponsors, in determining an applicant's eligibility for aid and in deciding final award amounts. All college-bound students should make filling out the FAFSA their top priority before pursuing any scholarships or grants.

## General Scholarships and Grants in Rhode Island

The Rhode Island Higher Education Assistance Authority administers two basic financial aid programs for the state's resident college-bound students. Eligibility for these programs is decided on the basis of academic achievement and financial need. As with all state funded financial aid for college, programs

are subject to changes in legislation and the current availability of state funds.

- The  Rhode  Island  State  Grant  Program  (http://www.riheaa.org/sng/sg\_prog\_detail.php)  -  The  State  Grant  Program  is  designed  to  provide financial support to students whose families do not have the resources to meet the costs of a post-secondary education. To be eligible for an award, applicants must be legal residents of Rhode Island who are enrolled, or are preparing to enroll, in a degree granting program at a state college or university. Eligible students must be attending classes on at least a halftime basis. Annual award amounts range from $250 to $700.
- The Rhode Island Academic Promise Program (http://www.riheaa.org/sng/ap\_prog\_detail.php) - The Academic Promise Scholarship is designed to provide financial assistance to high achieving college students with significant financial need. To be eligible for the program, students must be high school seniors who are planning to enroll full-time at an accredited college or university within the state. Final award determination is based on the combination of the student's SAT or ACT scores and their financial need. Applicants with the highest SAT or ACT scores will be first in line for  a  scholarship.  This  scholarship  is  renewable,  and  students  will  remain  eligible  for  an  annual  award  as  long  as  their  college  GPA  shows  a continued improvement. The minimum acceptable GPA for the student's first year is 2.50, for their second year it is 2.62, and for their third year it is 2.75. The annual maximum award is $2500, with a cumulative four year maximum of $10,000.

## Scholarships from the Rhode Island Foundation

In addition to the programs administered by the Rhode Island Education Assistance Authority, students will find an extensive selection of scholarships and grants available through the Rhode Island Foundation (http://www.rifoundation.org/Default.aspx). The Rhode Island Foundation is the state's premier charitable foundation, and is devoted to the health and educational needs of residents within the state. The foundation manages more than 150 scholarships and fellowships (http://www.rifoundation.org/Scholarships/ScholarshipOpportunities/tabid/190/Default.aspx) for Rhode Island residents struggling to meet the rising costs of a college education. The majority of these scholarships are privately endowed, and students may apply through the Rhode Island Foundation or the college or university of their choice.

The following examples of scholarships managed by the Rhode Island Foundation should give students an idea of the wide variety of programs that are available to resident students of the Ocean State.

- The Johnston Lions Armand Muto Scholarship - This scholarship is available to graduating high school seniors who are residents of Johnston County, and who are enrolled in an accredited post-secondary institution within the state. Award amounts vary, but the scholarship is renewable for up to four years.

- The Hans E. Gwinner and Berta E. Gwinner Scholarship -  This award is available to residents of Rhode Island who are attending Brown University, Bryant University or Providence College. Awards are determined by financial need and academic achievement. Students should apply through their school's offices of financial aid.
- The J.  D.  Edsal Scholarship -  This  program offers financial assistance to resident students who are studying film, television production, or advertising at one of Rhode Islands state colleges or universities. Award amounts vary, and are determined by academic achievement.
- The Jenna M. Kiernan Scholarship - This is a need-based scholarship available to Rhode Island residents of the Blackstone Valley. It is a onetime award, ranging from $500 to $1000.
- The Lawrence, Allen, Singletary Scholarship -  This  award is available to graduating seniors of Hope High School or Central High School. Awards are determined by financial need, academic achievement, and service to the community. Award amounts vary, but the scholarship is renewable for up to four years.

Resident college-bound students in Rhode Island may live in one of the smallest states in the Union, but they have access to some of the most valuable scholarships and grants in the country. Rhode Island students are encouraged to visit the dedicated websites of the Rhode Island Higher Education Assistance Authority (http://www.riheaa.org/), and the Rhode Island Foundation (http://www.rifoundation.org/Default.aspx) for more information on these and other financial aid programs designed to help them pay for college.

The government of the state of Maryland is determined to make higher education more accessible to its resident students. Through the Maryland Higher Education Commission (http://www.mhec.state.md.us/), state residents can find a wide array of grants, scholarships and tuition waivers designed to make college more affordable.

## The FAFSA and Government Financial Aid

All Federal and state supported financial aid for college students requires the submission of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The information supplied by the student on their FAFSA is used to prepare a Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report), which outlines the level of financial aid for which the applicant has qualified. The submission of the FAFSA should be made a priority, and should be completed before beginning the search for any college financial aid.

The maximum annual award is $2500, and cumulative awards can not surpass $5000. For every year that the recipient teaches in an eligible school district, 25% of the student's loan will be forgiven.

Recipients of the Teacher Education Loan must agree  to  teach  in  a  designated  Wisconsin  school  district  following  graduation.  For  each  year  the  student teaches  in  an  eligible  school  district,  50%  of  their  loan  will  be  forgiven.  If  the  student  fails  to  meet  their service obligations they will be required to repay their loan at an interest rate of 5%.

## Financial Aid Programs In Vermont

## Go to School for Less

A reliable source for information about the types of financial aid available to college students in Vermont is the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation (http://services.vsac.org/wps/wcm/connect/vsac/vsac) (VSAC). VSAC is a public nonprofit created by the state of Vermont in 1965 to provide information about and access to the college planning process, including financial resources like grants, scholarships, and loans. The following is an outline of Vermont's current aid programs for students.

## Grants From The State Of Vermont

VSAC administers three grant programs, all of which require you to create a user account (called a myVSAC (https://secureacctaccess.vsac.org/vsm/login) account) so you can submit an application and track its progress online. There is also an option for schools to register online in order to help students manage their college aid applications. Note: Grants given for degree programs require you to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which can also be completed either online or by mail.

- The Vermont Incentive grants are for undergraduates with financial need who are enrolled full-time (at least 12  credit  hours)  at  a  school  that  takes  part  in  the  Pell  Grant  program.  Applicants  must  be  residents  of Vermont, but they may receive grants even if they attend colleges in other states. Grant amounts vary with a student's degree of need and cost of attendance, and according to available funding.If you already have a bachelor's degree, you are not eligible for a Vermont Incentive grant unless you are studying medicine at the University of Vermont or enrolled in a veterinary medicine program.
- The  Vermont  Part-Time  grants  go  to  Vermont  residents  enrolled  less  than  full-time.  As  with  the  Vermont Incentive, applicants cannot have bachelor's degrees with only two exceptions for medical studies, and the amount  you  receive  depends  on  financial  need  and  cost  of  attendance.  Funding  is  limited  and  priority  is assigned to early applicants, so you can improve your chances by acting promptly.
- The Vermont Non-Degree grants are designed to pay for courses that make you more employable or help you pursue further studies. You may receive grants for two terms per year, up to a maximum of six. The courses you take may be offered by a college, continuing education center, or private training organization.

## Find A Scholarship Through VSAC

VSAC maintains a helpful page of detailed information on where to find scholarships (http://services.vsac.org/wps/wcm/connect/VSAC/VSAC/Pay+for+College/Funding+Sources/Scholarships/), including a downloadable booklet containing listings for about 150 current scholarships (2013-2014 academic year). To be eligible for VSAC-assisted scholarships, you must qualify as a Vermont resident, you must file a FAFSA, and you must submit a Unified Scholarship Application to VSAC. Documentation requirements vary among the scholarships.

Here is a sampling of the available awards:

- The Don and Peg Arnold Scholarship is one of the many local scholarships that are for residents of particular parts of Vermont (in this case, the towns that use the Shoreham Telephone Company). Applicants must show both academic excellence and financial need, and the award pays $5,000.
- The Alfred T. Granger Student Art Fund Scholarship goes to art students majoring in fields like architecture, fine  arts,  design,  or  mechanical drawing (CAD). There are four $2,500 awards for undergraduates and two $5,000 awards for graduate students.
- The  Operation  Enduring  Freedom  and  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  Scholarship  is  given  to  children  of  military servicemembers serving in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom. You must demonstrate financial need, and awards range from $3,500 to $7,000 (the average amount is $5,000).
- The Nordic Educational Trust Scholarship, which pays for a vocational/technical school program lasting two years. Criteria are academic potential and financial need, and the two-year award is for $5,000 to $10,000.

As you can see, the list of VSAC-assisted scholarships offers a great deal of variety, and you will certainly be able to find some form of assistance suited to your needs therein. VSAC's other recommendations for sources of scholarship aid are local organizations and businesses, the school you plan to attend, and a short list of online resources like VSAC Online Presentations (http://www.vsacworkshopsonline.org/).

## Find A Loan Through VSAC

VSAC has compiled a page

(http://services.vsac.org/wps/wcm/connect/vsac/vsac/pay+for+college/funding+sources/loans? useDefaultDesc=0&amp;useDefaultDesc=0) of information summarizing your federal loan options. There's also a private loan available through VSAC called the Vermont Advantage, and while you should always take federal loans before private loans, if your college budget still has a gap after you've exercised your federal options then by all means consider the Vermont Advantage product.

## Vermont Advantage Private Loan

Vermont Advantage

(http://services.vsac.org/wps/wcm/connect/vsac/vsac/pay+for+college/funding+sources/loans/vsac+-+pay++funding+sources+-+loans+-+vsac+fixed+rate+private+education+loan) loans are given to both Vermont

residents, wherever they attend school, and to out-of-state students going to school in Vermont. To be eligible for the Vermont Advantage loan, you must:

- Have U.S. citizenship or eligible non-citizen status
- Have a cosigner with good credit
- Be an undergraduate, graduate student, or professional student
- Be enrolled at least half-time
- Be eligible for financial aid from the federal government, and
- Not have a VSAC loan in default status.

You can apply online at VSAC, and your loan will take several weeks to process. Your school receives the loan proceeds after the federally mandated 'Right to Cancel' period has ended. The terms of the Vermont Advantage loan are straightforward: you may choose one of three fixed-rate plans depending on your repayment preference. Here are your rate options:

- 6.6% if you start repaying both principal and interest while you're still in school
- 7.0% if you repay only the interest while in school
- 7.9% if you defer payments altogether while in school.

Loan origination fees depend on your cosigner's credit rating. If it's excellent, you pay no fee. Otherwise the fee is either 3% or 5%.

## Scholarships And Grants From Arkansas

## Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund

Arkansas higher education includes an established presence of highly respected colleges and universities.  Arkansas State University, Henderson State University (http://www.hsu.edu/), University of Arkansas and Arkansas Tech (http://www.atu.edu/) are only a few of the noted educators operating within the state.  To support the educational pursuits of motivated state students, the Arkansas Department of Higher Education (http://www.adhe.edu/Pages/home.aspx) is responsible for a stable of financial assistance that increases access to higher education for state high school graduates.

Some of the aid programs maintained by Arkansas are for general consumption, but others require unique eligibility characteristics. Your high school guidance counselor or Arkansas college-campus financial aid administrators maintain up-to-date information about eligibility standards.

<!-- image -->

These examples illustrate Arkansas' commitment to higher education:

## Academic Challenge Scholarships

Partially funded by the Arkansas State Lottery, Challenge Scholarships (http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_acs.aspx) are available for most state students - regardless of academic status.  Recent high school graduates, students already enrolled at state institutions of higher education, and returning student who are getting back into education, following absences, are each eligible to apply for the funding.  Successful participants complete at least 27 academic credits during their first year in the program, and a minimum of 30 credit hours during subsequent years of participation.  Cumulative GPA performance of at least 2.75 is required, along with general eligibility standards like:

- State residency
- Pursuing first degree
- FAFSA filed
- No student loan defaults
- Drug free
- Registered with Selective Service

Application deadline is June 1st, for Fall semester aid disbursal.

## Ellen Carpenter HBCU Scholarship

Minorities benefit exclusively from some Arkansas financial aid initiatives.  The Ellen Carpenter HBCU Scholarship targets minority students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  Scholarship values fall between $1000 and $5000, depending on available funding.  Awards are applied to tuition expenses at these approved, participating Arkansas colleges:  Arkansas Baptist,

Save

Philander Smith College (http://www.philander.edu/), and University of Arkansas- Pine Bluff.

## Governor's Scholars Program

Governor's Scholars are graduating high school seniors, who qualify for up to $4000 each - per year, by demonstrating outstanding performance and potential in these areas:

- Academics
- Test Scores
- Leadership Activities

Governor's Distinguished Scholarships (http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_govscholars.aspx) are worth as much as $10,ooo each, to the cream of the academic crop. High-achievers, who maintain 3.5 GPA are eligible to apply, provided ACT standards of 32, or SAT scores of at least 1410 are attained.

## Public Service Scholarships

Two distinct Arkansas programs provide education allowances for dependents of public servants making great sacrifices in the line of duty.

## Law Enforcement Officers' Dependents Scholarship Program

Tuition is waived, and other colleges expenses are paid, for spouses and children of law enforcement staff who are disabled or killed while performing official duties. The Law Enforcement Officers' Dependents Scholarship Program

(http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_leod.aspx) also applies to certain family members of Highway and Transportation Department employees meeting similar, tragic fates.

## Military Dependents Scholarship Program

Dependents of military personnel who are killed or disabled, in the line of duty, are eligible for Arkansas financial aid that acknowledges the ultimate sacrifice.  Public colleges, universities and technical schools qualify for student assistance from this state initiative (http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_mds.aspx).

## Special Arkansas State Grants

## Higher Education Opportunities Grant

Need-based aid helps students aspire beyond their financial limitations.  In Arkansas, Higher Education Opportunities Grants (http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_gogrant.aspx) (GO!

- Accepted for attendance at an approved school
- Meet standards for full or part-time student status

Grants are valued at $1000 each for full-time students, who must each complete 12 credits during their first semester of participation , and at least 15 credits during subsequent semesters.  Part-time students garner grants worth $500 each, and qualify by maintaining consistent enrollment of at least 6 academic credits.

## Arkansas Health Education Grant

The Arkansas Health Education Grant Program (http://www.adhe.edu/divisions/financialaid/Pages/fa\_arheg.aspx) (ARHEG), funded by the state of Arkansas, provides assistance for certain out-of-state accredited medical and health professional schools.  Graduate and professional programs that are unavailable in Arkansas, are attended outside the state, but subject to in-state tuition rates. This assistance is available for attending accredited schools of dentistry, optometry, veterinary medicine, podiatry, chiropractic medicine or osteopathic medicine. Qualified institutions of higher education meet the following standards for participation in the ARHEG initiative.

## College Funding In Utah

## Stand Out Among the Crowd and Win Some Cash

Every state offers some level of financial support for its resident college-bound students, and Utah is no exception. The state of Utah, and the Utah Board of Regents, understands that the success of any state lies in the educational opportunities available to its residents. To this end, the state government of Utah offers resident students financial advice and assistance via the Utah System of Higher Education (http://www.higheredutah.org/).

In addition to much needed financial aid, the Utah System of Higher Education's dedicated website provides valuable information on state colleges and universities, college savings plans, application procedures, and test preparedness. Residents of the Beehive State will find that their state government is dedicated to rewarding the hard work, and the academic achievements, of its college-bound students.

## General Scholarships from the State of Utah

The state of Utah offers two scholarships for graduating high school seniors who have achieved high academic standards in their secondary education. These scholarships are strictly merit-based, and awards are determined by the applicants high school transcripts.

The following two scholarships are currently being offered by the state of Utah.

- The  Utah  New  Century  Scholarship  Program  (http://www.higheredutah.org/scholarship\_info/new-centuryscholarship/)  is  available  to  high  performing  high  school  students  who  are  simultaneously  enrolled  in  an associates degree program at a state college or university. Students must complete their associates degree with  a  3.0  GPA  or  better  by  the  time  they  graduate  from  high  school.  Scholarship  recipients  may  use  the award to help pay for Baccalaureate studies at a participating state college or university. The award is $1250 per semester, and is renewable.
- The Utah Regents Scholarship (http://www.higheredutah.org/scholarship\_info/regents-scholarship/) is designed to encourage high school students to prepare for college by taking a core course of studies, and by saving  for  college.  The  scholarship  is  a  tiered  award  system  that  includes  a Base Award, an Exemplary Academic  Achievement  Award , and  the Utah  Educational  Savings  Plan  Supplemental  Award . Students may be eligible to win one, or any combination, of the three awards. To be eligible, students must be enrolled full-time at a participating state college or university, and must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA. Award amounts range from $400 to $1000.
- The Terrell H. Bell Teaching Incentive Loan Program (http://higheredutah.org/sbr/policy/pdf/R603.pdf) is, in essence,  an  award-for-service  program.  A  state-funded  loan  is  available  to  high  school  seniors  who  have completed  the  requirements  for  an  Early  Graduation  Program,  and  who  have  declared  education  as  their major. Following graduation students must agree to a predetermined term of service teaching at one of Utah's public or private schools. Each semester of teaching will be considered as repayment for each semester of received financial aid. Graduating students are allowed a 2 year grace period in which to find employment. If, after 2 years they have not taken a teaching position, the award will be enforced as a standard student loan.

## The Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education

In addition to the programs offered through the Utah System of Higher Education, resident students of the Beehive State can take advantage of initiatives supported by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (http://www.wiche.edu/). The WICHE is a regional organization that was created in the 1950′s by the Western Regional Education Compact. The purpose of the WICHE is to facilitate the sharing of resources amongst the western states, and to make higher education more accessible to residents of participating states.

Many of the programs supported by the WICHE address critical areas of professional need, including education and healthcare. The WICHE makes it possible for students from Utah to pursue their education in a neighboring state, while retaining the tuition reductions and tax advantages typically reserved for a state's own resident students. While no scholarships or grants are offered directly by the WICHE, the program's initiatives do allow Utah's college-bound students to save money on the cost of attending college or university in a participating state. The WICHE initiatives open up tuition discounts, financial aid programs, and tax advantages that are typically reserved for residents of the host state.

Preparing for college takes serious financial planning. Through Federal grants and loans, and state supported scholarships and loan-forgiveness programs, Utah's resident students can build a financial plan that will help them realize their college goals. College-bound students in the state of Utah will want to visit the Utah System for Higher Education's (http://www.higheredutah.org/) dedicated website for further information designed to help them plan for their post-secondary education. There, students and their families will find valuable information on tuition costs, college savings plans, and how to prepare for a transition from high school to college.

## Washington State Scholarships And Grants

## Take Care of Those College Expenses

Washington State, like other states across the country, supports a wide range of scholarships, grants and college loans for its resident students. These programs are sponsored by Washington's state government, and administered through the Washington Student Achievement Council (http://www.wsac.wa.gov/). The underlying purpose of all of these state supported financial aid programs is to make college more accessible to the resident students of Washington State.

## The FAFSA

The first step in every college-bound student's search for state, or Federal, supported financial aid is to fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine the student's eligibility for government funded financial aid, and the ultimate level of that financial aid. The FAFSA is also used by many independent scholarship, grant and loan providers in the determination of financial aid awards. College-bound students should make filling out the FAFSA a priority in their search for college funding.

<!-- image -->

Like many states across the country, Washington provides a variety of general grants and scholarships for its resident college-bound students. A combination of merit-based and need-based programs, these grants and scholarships are designed to put a college education within the reach of a greater number of deserving students.

## Subject Specific Financial Aid Programs

Many states, Washington included, support financial aid programs designed to benefit students with specific career paths. These programs may take the form of scholarships, loans or loan repayment plans. In many cases these will be award-for-service programs, offering financial aid in return for a predetermined term of service in a high need profession within the state.

Washington State currently supports the following subject specific financial aid programs.

- The  Washington  Aerospace  Loan  Program  (http://www.wsac.wa.gov/PayingForCollege/StateAid/Aerospace) provides low interest loans to resident students who are enrolled in the Washington Aerospace Training and Research Center. Students can receive up to $4800 in loans to pay for specific training in various aerospace production fields.
- The Health Professional Loan Repayment Program (http://www.wsac.wa.gov/PayingForCollege/FinancialAid/HealthProfessional) provides partial loan forgiveness for  licensed  healthcare  professionals  who  agree  to  provide  primary  healthcare  services  in  rural  or  underserved urban areas. Loan repayments are contingent upon the completion of the agreed upon term of service.

## Washington, D.C. Scholarships And Grants

## Do You Need Money for School in D.C.?

The District of Columbia offers financial aid to college students through the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), an agency that functions just like similar agencies in state governments. The office has set up a page

(http://educationcenter.dc.gov/ec/cwp/view,a,1307,q,581465.asp) collecting its information on scholarships and grants, for which you can apply in a unified online process called the DC OneApp.

For the 2013-2014 school year, the district has limited funds available to help college students, so residents are urged to complete the DC OneApp process as quickly as possible to maximize their chances to receive assistance. If you need counseling on how to prepare for college and obtain the necessary financing, a nonprofit called the District of Columbia College Access Program (http://www.dccap.org/) (DC-CAP) has been established to advise you on how the process works. Current District of Columbia financial aid programs are discussed below.

## Grants From the District of Columbia

## District Of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant

The District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Grant

(http://osse.dc.gov/service/dctag-get-funding-college) (DCTAG) program provides a maximum of $10,000 per year to cover the difference between instate and out-of-state tuition at public four-year institutions of higher education so that District of Columbia students can attend schools elsewhere. The most you can collect is $50,000 after a six-year period has elapsed.

If you enroll in a public two-year school, you receive $2,500 a year, capped at $10,000 overall. And if you choose one of the four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), or a private school in the District of Columbia metro area, the annual maximum is $2,500 and the lifetime limit $12,500.

Note: For the public two-year school DCTAG grants, the award period is limited to four years rather than six.

Eligibility criteria for DCTAG include the following requirements. You must:

<!-- image -->

- Be a U. S. citizen or eligible non-citizen.
- Attend an approved institution (http://osse.dc.gov/page/dctag-eligible-institutions).
- Have lived in the District of Columbia for at least one year before your first enrollment in college, and you must continue to so reside until you graduate. If you are still a dependent under 24, your parents' residency governs.
- Be seeking a first degree at least half-time and maintaining satisfactory progress.
- Not be in default on a student loan from the U. S. government.
- Be 24 at most.

## District Of Columbia Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program

The District of Columbia Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program (http://osse.dc.gov/service/dcleap-get-funding-college) (DCLEAP) provides grants for as much as $950 per year to residents of the District of Columbia. The most you can collect overall is $5,700 and there is a sixyear limit on receiving the award. At least half-time attendance is necessary for eligibility, and the amount of the grant will be prorated accordingly.

Only courses taken in the fall and spring semesters will qualify, and you may apply for DCLEAP using the DC OneApp. Eligibility criteria for DCLEAP are almost identical to those for DCTAG, with one main difference: you must meet the standard promulgated by the U. S. Department of Education for financial need in order to win DCLEAP funding, while DCTAG is available to any student with an annual household income of less than a million dollars, as of 2013.

## Scholarships From the District of Columbia

## District Of Columbia Adoption Scholarship

The District of Columbia Adoption Scholarship (http://write.collegescholarships.org/alexa-projectnine-14-draft/www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefitdetails/2751) (DCAS) program pays a benefit similar to that given by DCTAG to students at public four-year schools (that is, maximums of $10,000 each year and $50,000 overall). DCAS assists student who live in the District of Columbia and were adopted or lost a parent as a result of 9/11.

Save

Since the district has restricted academic funding for the current year, you should check with OSSE to make sure the DCAS program is active when you need to apply.

## Aid Recommended by the District of Columbia

## United States Senate Youth Program

The United States Senate Youth Program (http://osse.dc.gov/service/united-states-senate-youth-program-ussyp) (USSYP) is an excellent government scholarship offer that does not get a great deal of publicity, and it's commendable of OSSE to spotlight it. USSYP involves outstanding students in activities undertaken in the course of government business, sending them to hear legislators and members of the President's cabinet speak.

It's a very important opportunity designed to attract top performers into public service, and USSYP selects only students from the top one percent of class rankings, choosing two from each state plus the District of Columbia and the Department of Defense Education Activity, which educates children of military servicemembers abroad. The honor comes with an award of $5,000 for college tuition.

## Financial Aid From Schools

Many schools in the DC metro area sponsor their own financial aid programs, like the following examples:

- Georgetown University (http://finaid.georgetown.edu/grants-and-scholarships/scholarships/) maintains separate listings for undergraduate and graduate scholarships.
- The University of the District of Columbia is an HBCU that provides its own scholarships and also works with a prominent nonprofit scholarship provider called the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (http://www.thurgoodmarshallfund.net/scholarship/about-scholarships-program).
- Another HBCU, prestigious Howard University, has posted a comprehensive guide to its financial support for students here (http://www.howard.edu/financialaid/).

## College Scholarships And Grants In Louisiana

## Do You Need Money for School in Louisiana?

The state of Louisiana has set up an agency called the Louisiana Office of Student Financial Assistance (http://www.osfa.state.la.us/) (LOSFA) to administer its financial aid programs. LOSFA maintains an older but still serviceable website where you can find all the information currently available on the different types of monetary assistance given to Louisiana students.

## Taylor Opportunity Program For Students

The Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (http://www.osfa.state.la.us/schgrt6.htm) (TOPS) is a scholarship program that serves as the state's primary conduit of financial aid to college students. Established in 1998, TOPS was originally intended as a way to help needy students attend college in Louisiana, but local politicians saw a shortcut to popularity and changed the criteria to direct funding to middle-class families instead.

Although TOPS had become what is usually called a merit-based award, the academic performance standard demanded was so low as to be attainable by a great many average students, which has recently presented challenges in funding. Budget constraints are beginning to tighten the TOPS criteria, but since it is still considered politically perilous to make any major encroachment on this entitlement, funding part of your college education using TOPS is very easy for Louisiana students.

TOPS is distributed to all students who attend school in Louisiana and can clear a minimal bar in terms of scores and grades. Payment, therefore, is virtually guaranteed, and if you lose eligibility before completing your degree program no reimbursement is sought by the state. Each of the four levels of payment TOPS makes is based on your academic performance, and TOPS pays all or part of your tuition, plus some fees.

There are lists of eligible institutions posted under these four categories:

Louisiana Public Colleges and Universities, Louisiana Community and Technical

<!-- image -->

College System, Proprietary and Cosmetology Schools approved by the state, and members of a group called the Louisiana Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. The four levels of award are described below.

- The TOPS Opportunity Award pays the weighted average of tuition at public institutions that grant degrees. This award goes to students at schools in the Louisiana Public Colleges and Universities category. The required GPA is 2.5, and you must have a standardized test score of 20 (ACT) or 1020 (SAT) to qualify.
- The TOPS Performance Award is even more generous, paying not only tuition but also approved fees and $400 of your living expenses if you attend a school in the Louisiana Public Colleges and Universities category. You may also attend one of the schools in the Louisiana Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, but only the weighted average of public school tuition (plus the stipend) will be paid. You must have a GPA of 3.0 and a test score of 23 (ACT) or 1050 (SAT).
- The TOPS Honors Award criteria are almost identical to those for the Performance Award, with two important exceptions: the required ACT is 27 (or SAT of 1210), and the stipend is doubled to $800.
- The TOPS Tech Award is given to students at a school in any of the four eligible categories who are pursuing a degree or certification in some form of occupational training. If you are in such a program at an eligible four-year school instead of one of the cheaper schools in the Community and Technical College System or the Proprietary and Cosmetology Schools, you will receive only the amount of tuition charged at one of the cheaper schools.

However, the scores required are an ACT of 17 or an SAT of 820, which are very easy to reach.

## Rockefeller State Wildlife Scholarship

The Rockefeller State Wildlife Scholarship (http://www.osfa.state.la.us/rock.htm) goes to students at schools in the Louisiana Public Colleges and Universities category who are majoring in forestry, wildlife, or marine science. The Rockefeller brings $2,000 a year to undergraduates and $3,000 to graduate students. The scholarship is capped at $12,000 for three years (undergraduate) or two years (graduate work). Here are the eligibility criteria:

- You must be a U. S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen.
- You must have one year of in-state residency as of July 1 of the year in which you receive the scholarship.
- You must attend school full-time, and undergraduates must have 60 credit hours plus a 2.5 GPA. Graduate students must maintain a 3.0 GPA.

## Other Financial Aid

Many local organizations in Louisiana offer their own awards to help college students, so check with your town's social clubs and businesses. The Louisiana Solid Waste Association hands out the Dr. Gordon P. Boutwell, Jr. Memorial Scholarship ($1,000 to a student in an environmental field), the Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation gives $1,500 scholarships (http://www.lfbf.org/foundation/) to agricultural students, and there are numerous similar philanthropic contributions made each year.

## South Dakota Scholarship And Grant Details

## Take Advantage of Government Financial Aid

The South Dakota Board of Regents (http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/html/cem/cem98/cem9828.html) (SDBOR) is the governing body established by the state to oversee the public system of higher education. SDBOR has a challenging task because South Dakota's government has no large source of funding like that provided by an income tax. Instead, it has a rural economy, and its universities are widely scattered.

However, SDBOR is surprisingly adept at making the most of its limited resources and geographic dispersal, combining classes offered by different institutions to offer a larger variety of majors in an attempt to keep South Dakota's college students in their home state. That canny management is reflected in the state's financial aid, which focuses on scholarships and loan forgiveness.

## Scholarships From the State of South Dakota

## South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship

The South Dakota Opportunity Scholarship (http://sdos.sdbor.edu/) (SDOS) reflects that emphasis on paying for results by doubling the award amount in the student's last undergraduate year. SDOS brings $1,000 per year for the first three years and $2,000 in the fourth year, and is available for students in the 18 schools listed on the web page. Students are eligible for a total of eight consecutive terms, or four academic years; alternately, you can receive SDOS until acquiring a bachelors degree.

The SDOS looks for students with an acceptable college admissions test score (at least 1090 for the SAT, and 24 for the ACT). You must submit a high school transcript with your application.

## Dakota Corps Scholarship

The Dakota Corps Scholarship

(http://www.sdbor.edu/dakotacorps/welcome.htm) attempts to retain talented

<!-- image -->

South Dakota students by offering a financial incentive to study and work in-state. The program aims to cover tuition and fees, and to that end your school must also provide financial support by covering the remaining tuition and fees, if any. Various equivalency amounts for payments exist, depending on the school you attend:

- Full-time tuition and fees at an SDBOR school, meaning a public college or university (amount #1)
- Amount #1 given to a student attending a private school (nonprofits only).
- Full-time tuition and fees at a tribal college (if applicable).
- Individually allocated amounts for students at technical colleges, which cannot be larger than amount #1.

The Dakota Corps Scholarship is intended for college-bound high school students, and funding for the program is limited. Not all eligible students receive assistance, and participation is at the institution's discretion.

To receive the scholarship, you must make a service commitment and agree to work in what is called a critical need occupation. The duration of your employment must be the number of years you accepted financial support plus one, meaning five years of work repays four scholarship years. You must work in South Dakota, and the required fields are subject to change, so check with the state's website for current information.

As of 2013, accepted fields include teaching (math, science, special education, or vocational training), accounting, engineering, information technology, and nursing.

## Board Of Regents Endowed Scholarships

There are four Board of Regents Endowed Scholarships (http://sdbor.edu/students/borscholar.htm), as follows:

- The Ardell Bjugstad Scholarship is awarded to freshmen of Native American heritage who are seeking degrees in fields related to agriculture (such as agricultural sciences, agribusiness, or farm production) or in natural resources.
- The Haines Memorial Scholarship goes to an education major at one of these five schools: Black Hills State University (BHSU), Dakota State University (DSU), Northern State University (NSU), South Dakota State University, and the University of South Dakota (USD). To qualify, you must be an undergraduate in at least the sophomore year who is majoring in education.

Save

- The Annis Irene Fowler/Kaden Scholarship is given to a first-time freshman at BHSU, DSU, NSU, or USD who intends to work in elementary education and displays strong motivation (perhaps by pursuing a degree in spite of a disability, or being financially independent).
- The Marlin R. Scarborough Memorial Scholarship supports a junior at a public university, and each of the South Dakota public schools can make a nomination.

## Federal Loan Forgiveness For Teachers

As you have seen above, the state of South Dakota is determined to train as many teachers as possible. As part of that effort, SDBOR refers education majors to the U. S. Department of Education's Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program (http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgivenesscancellation/charts/teacher). Under the terms of the program, if you teach for five straight years in designated schools used by low-income populations, you may qualify for forgiveness of some student loans.

Specifically, forgiveness up to $17,500 on the combined amounts of your Direct loans (both Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and their cognates from the old Stafford loan program. Any default on an old loan must be remedied before you apply, although working out a repayment plan with the lender will meet that requirement.

You can learn more about other federal financial aid offers for South Dakota students here (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm).

## Grant And Scholarship Programs In Alaska

## In Need of Financial Aid?

The state of Alaska has established an agency called the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education (http://acpe.alaska.gov/) (ACPE) to administer its student financial aid programs and assist Alaska students in plotting a financial route through college. ACPE also offers advice on training for careers, to encourage all state residents to acquire some type of post-secondary education.

Alaska has simplified its state-supported financial aid and now offers one type of scholarship and one type of grant, both of which are funded by a new trust called the Alaska Higher Education Investment Fund. One of ACPE's duties is monitoring schools in Alaska, to make sure their financial and management practices are acceptable and to verify their capability for fulfilling their educational promises, and you can find a list of ACPEapproved post-secondary schools here (http://acpe.alaska.gov/EDUCATOR-

SCHOOL/Postsecondary\_Institutions/Institutional\_Authorization/Alaska\_Postsecondary\_Institutions.aspx).

<!-- image -->

## Alaska Performance Scholarship

There are two types of Alaska Performance Scholarship (http://acpe.alaska.gov/STUDENT-

PARENT/Grants\_Scholarships/Alaska\_Performance\_Scholarship.aspx) (APS), the Collegiate Award and the Career and Technical Education Award. The ACPE website has laid out a readily understandable series of pages that make it very simple for you to navigate the process of securing an APS scholarship.

You may receive APS funding for a total of eight semesters.

## APS Collegiate Award

The Collegiate Award goes to high school students who have earned a GPA of at least 2.5 plus an ACT of 21 or SAT of 1450 in a curriculum designated by ACPE as rigorous (http://acpe.alaska.gov/STUDENT-

PARENT/Grants\_Scholarships/APS\_FAQs/Curriculum.aspx), and want to attend college. That standard can also be met by the curricula of private and home schools as long as they have been approved by the Alaska Department of Education. Alaska defines its rigorous college-preparatory curriculum as one of two sets of courses, as follows:

- Four years each of math, science, English, and social studies. In exchange for one year of social studies, you may complete a year of fine arts, cultural heritage, or foreign language (including the Alaska Native language and American Sign Language). That is called the Math and Science option.
- For the Social Studies and Language track, you will take four years each of English and social studies, plus three years each of math and science, plus two years of a single foreign language (as defined above).

There are different requirements for each of the three amounts you can receive through the APS Collegiate Award program, and your high school will report your level to ACPE:

- Level 1 requires a GPA of 3.5 plus an ACT of 25 or SAT of 1680, and the maximum annual amount is $4,755.
- Level 2 steps down to a 3.0 GPA and 23 on the ACT/1560 SAT, and brings as much as $3,566 a year.
- Level 3 is awarded for average performance (GPA of 2.5, ACT 21/SAT 1450), and it is worth $2,378 at most.

## APS Career And Technical Education Award

The APS Career and Technical Education Award is for those who intend to seek job training, and instead of the testing required for college students applicants will need to submit a qualifying WorkKeys (http://www.act.org/workkeys/assess/) score. WorkKeys is an alternate testing system devised by the same company that produces the ACT test, and its purpose is to determine your level of preparation for a career.

The current WorkKeys requirement is a combined score of 13, with no individual score under 4. Be sure to check with ACPE for any updates.

## AlaskAdvantage Education Grant

## The AlaskAdvantage Education Grant (http://acpe.alaska.gov/STUDENT-

PARENT/Grants\_Scholarships/AlaskAdvantage\_Education\_Grant.aspx) (AEG) is handed out based on financial need, and while its amount usually varies between $500 and $2,000, there is a special category of award providing up to $3,000. The priority AEGs are reserved for students scoring in the top quartile on the SAT or ACT, and for students in designated workforce shortage areas. Current workforce shortage areas are health science, social service, education, and extracting and processing Alaska's natural resources.

Every year, the AEGs are distributed to the students with higher financial need first, continuing to give out money until funding is exhausted. There is a list of criteria for applicants, according to which you must meet these requirements:

- Live in Alaska and be either a U. S. citizen or a permanent resident.
- Have a high school diploma or GED equivalent.
- Have gained admittance into a program granting a degree or certificate.
- Attend school at least half-time and make acceptable progress in school.
- Have at least $500 you cannot pay in educational costs.
- Not already have a four-year degree.
- Meet eligibility standards for receiving student financial aid through the federal Title IV program.

You should be aware of the importance of your enrollment status. The AEG program begins allotting grant money to individual students at the beginning of the academic year, when schools send in their certifications of student enrollment. There are always applications that are denied because funding has run out, so you must make a point of enrolling as early as possible in a qualifying course of study.

## Other Alaska Scholarships And Grants

There are two recommended primary sources for locating additional scholarships and grants. Your school's financial aid office will supply useful information on not only institutional aid available from the school itself but on scholarships and grants underwritten by outside groups. As an example, the University of Alaska Southeast has posted a page (http://write.collegescholarships.org/alexa-projectseven-16-draft/www.uas.alaska.edu/finaid/) advertising its scholarship assistance, which reaches approximately one-third of applicants and can be as much as $5,000.

The federal government is a reliable provider of student financial aid like scholarships and grants (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm), and should always be consulted in any search for student assistance.

## College Aid For North Carolina Students

## Selling Yourself for Financial Gain

North Carolina is host to an extensive selection of premier colleges and universities.  In addition to the University of North Carolina and NC State; Duke (http://www.duke.edu/), Wake Forest and Appalachian State (http://www.appstate.edu/) are located within North Carolina's borders.  Average cost of attending North Carolina State University for the 2012-13 school year; including tuition, room and board exceeds $20,000 (http://www.ncsu.edu/future-students/can-i-afford-it/), so North Carolina students of higher education face the same financial hurdles confronting other students around the country.

Large-scale federal college assistance programs serve North Carolina students, including Pell Grants, FSEOG Grants (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/fseog/index.html) and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loans. (http://www.direct.ed.gov/)  But when  funding shortfalls exist beyond the reach of Federal Financial Aid dollars, North Carolina students turn to state-specific assistance

(https://www.collegescholarships.org/scholarships/states.htm) to close the affordability gap.

Since many NC financial aid programs use the federal application to qualify students, filing the Free Application for federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA) is the first step for North Carolina aid-seekers.  The application opens the door to Department of Education (http://www.ed.gov/) assistance, but it also gets the ball rolling for these forms of North Carolina financial aid:

- State sponsored
- Privately funded
- Need-based
- Merit-based
- Camous specific
- Career specific

<!-- image -->

## Need-Based Aid for North Carolina Higher Education

The North Carolina State Education Assistance Authority (http://www.ncseaa.edu/) administers a far-reaching portfolio of student financial aid.  One popular program for under-funded students, the North Carolina Student Incentive Grant (NCSIG), is offered to North Carolina resident students attending  state colleges and universities full time. However, the grant does not apply to students enrolled in career courses for religious vocations.

To be considered for state aid, North Carolina applicants are required to file FAFSA requests before the state deadline. Current opportunities for state-sponsored financial aid in North Carolina include:

## Getting College Aid From Your Local State Government

## California Scholarship and Grant Selections

Federal financial aid plays a large role for most college students, but cash-strapped university-bound scholars should not overlook state aid for rounding out the college cash coffers.

Fifty states yield miscellaneous approaches to student aid, but most have arrangements in-place to supplement federal efforts.  State initiatives often mirror federal programs. In fact, most states use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA) to assess each applicant's financial aid needs.

California embraces its long history of educational success with a comprehensive higher education assistance plan that stands as one of the country's most generous state programs.  The California Student Aid Commission (http://www.csac.ca.gov/) (CSAC) operates under a simply, yet ambitious directive:  Make higher education financially accessible to all Californians.

Grants and scholarships from The Golden State can be applied to post-secondary education at universities and technical colleges, in pursuit of bachelor's degrees and other vocational credentials.  Applying for financial aid from the state of California requires that your FAFSA be submitted by March 2nd. The state's filing date is earlier than most, and falls well before the federal FAFSA deadline.

## California Scholarship and Grant Selections

The catch-all program for California college students is the CalGrant (http://www.calgrants.org/) suite of financial aid, which subsidizes higher education for most state residents.  Cal Grants provide something for everyone, with flexible college financing options tailored to a variety of circumstances.

The program is open to all California applicants, who are each required to submit two important documents before the March 2nd Cal Grant deadline:

The deadline is early, but the CSAC nurtures applicants with seminars in January and February that answer common questions.  Cash For College Workshops (http://www.calgrants.org/index.cfm?navId=16) provide stepby-step instruction for candidates, as they complete the required documents.  Low-income and first-generation students are encouraged to participate.

The progressive agency even uses hip-hop music to drive home the importance of the FAFSA.  Their tongue-incheek rap video tells viewers to 'fill out the FAFSA fool' (http://www.calgrants.org/index.cfm?navId=258).

Cal Grants provide tuition and training assistance for students continuing beyond high-school.  Cal Grant recipients are pursuing:

Depending on which type of Cal Grant helps you pay for school, the generous gift-aid can be applied toward expenses like:

High school seniors and recent graduates are invited to apply for individual Cal Grants totaling up to $12,000 per academic year.  In some cases, students lacking high school diplomas qualify for Cal Grants by submitting ACT or SAT scores to the California Student Aid Commission.

California disburses funds according to a multi-tier arrangement that provides assistance where it is most needed.

California Community College Transfer Entitlement Grant sets the table for transfer students who are making the transition from 2year schools to accredited 4-year degree programs.  Eligibility requires specific conditions:

## The Child Development Grant Program

(http://www.csac.ca.gov/doc.asp?id=110) is a survivor among many other education-oriented grant programs that have folded for lack of funding. Students are encouraged to compete for needbased tuition grants that apply to child care and development schooling.  In exchange for the awards, candidates must sign service commitment agreements that pledge one year of employment in a licenced child care facility, for each year grant money is received.  Half-time students seeking Child Development Permits should apply directly to their school's financial aid office.

- 1.  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
- 2.  Cal Grants GPA Verification Form
- Bachelor's Degrees
- Associate's Degrees
- Occupational Certification
- Tuition
- Room and Board
- Books
- Cal  Grant  A  Entitlement  Awards  are  for  students  attending  public  and  private  colleges.  California  State University  students  are  eligible  for  $5900  annually.  University  of  California  students  may  qualify  for  up  to $12,000 each year.  Private colleges are reimbursed up to $9200 for tuition and fees for qualifying students. Eligible  candidates  must  be  enrolled  in  two-year  or  four-year  degree  programs.    The  state  also  sets  aside about  11,000  'Competitive'  Cal  Grants  each  year  that  are  reserved  for  those  who  do  not  qualify  for entitlement money, but meet other Cal Grant A prerequisites.
- Cal Grant B provides cash for books and other living expenses associated with higher education.  Economically disadvantaged students each receive an initial grant that covers books and expenses, usually totalling more than $1400. After the first year, successful recipients continue to receive Cal Grant B money in similar amounts to the Cal Grant A program.
- Cal Grant C assists those students actively pursuing vocational or community college degrees or certificates. A minimum grant of $575 covers books, tools, equipment and other expenses, while private students qualify for up to $2500 toward tuition.
- Cal  Grant  A  Competitive  Awards  are  disbursed  to  students  with  GPA  of  3.0  or  higher.  Students  must  be enrolled in 2 or 4-year programs to qualify.
- Cal Grant B Competitive Awards are administered to only the most economically disadvantaged students. A minimum GPA of 2.0 is required, along with enrollment in a program that is at least 1-year in duration.
- Fulfill Cal Grant eligibility requirements
- Maintain a community college GPA of at least 2.4
- Graduate from California high-school after June 30, 2000
- Be a California resident on high-school graduation date
- Be under age 28 in first year receiving award

- Do not receive Cal Grant within one year of high-school graduation

Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents Grant Program (http://www.csac.ca.gov/doc.asp?id=109) mirrors the federal program that provides education reimbursement for children of soldiers, seamen and Marines killed in the line of duty. In California, any spouse or child of a member of the Highway Patrol, sheriffs office or police department who has been killed in service receives an education grant.

Some state aid initiatives strive to promote education among particular student groups.  In California, former foster youth are eligible for a special grant.  The Chafee Grant (https://www.chafee.csac.ca.gov/) is worth $5,000 (or more) to each winner.  Applicants must be former foster kids who are 22 years old at the time of application. Foster care eligibility is confirmed by the California Department of Social Services (http://www.dss.cahwnet.gov/cdssweb/default.htm).

Recipients must attend qualified schools, which include California colleges and universities, technical schools and eligible out of state institutions. In addition to foster care eligibility verification, applicants must submit:

- 1.  Chafee Grant Application (https://www.chafee.csac.ca.gov/StudentApplication.aspx)
- 2.  FAFSA
- 3.  Chafee Need Analysis report (NAR)

Financial need, half-time yearlong enrollment, and satisfactory academic progress must be maintained to remain eligible for the California Chafee Grant for Foster Youth.

## University of California - Berkeley Scholarships

The University of California at Berkeley provides school-specific aid to incoming undergraduates and returning students.  The Undergraduates Scholarships, Prizes and Honors unit of the Financial Aid and Scholarships Office (http://students.berkeley.edu/finaid/undergraduates/types\_scholarships.htm) administers a number of distinct programs.

## Berkeley Undergraduate Scholarships

(http://students.berkeley.edu/finaid/undergraduates/types\_berkunderscholarship.htm) are disbursed based on financial need and GPA performance.  Each Berkeley student is automatically placed in the running for these funds.

California Alumni Association Scholarships (http://alumni.berkeley.edu/services/scholarships) are widely disbursed among undergraduate students. Scholarships are awarded in two areas:

- Leadership Awards are solely merit-based and offered to freshman and transfer students who show immediate aptitude for leadership. Awards may be up to $2500 per academic year.
- Achievement  Awards  are  given  to financially needy  students coming  from  the  most  disadvantaged backgrounds. The more challenges a student has had to overcome, the more likely he or she is to receive this award. Up to $5700 is awarded each academic year.

Cal Opportunity Scholarship (http://students.berkeley.edu/finaid/undergraduates/types\_calopp.htm) offers aid to the most disadvantaged students trying to make it into one of the country's best schools. Applicants must be from one of the university's partner high schools, which are located in these school districts: San Francisco, West Contra Costa, Oakland Unified, and Ravenswood. There is a dedicated application process, as well as a faculty interview.

Regent's and Chancellor's Scholarships (http://students.berkeley.edu/finaid/undergraduates/types\_regents.htm) are merit-based scholarships that go to about 200 students each year.  Berkeley students are automatically considered for these awards, based on FAFSA results.

## California State University - Los Angeles

Cal State Scholarships (http://www.calstate.edu/foundation/Scholarship.shtml) are awarded by the California State University Foundation. Students are encouraged to inquire directly with campus financial aid offices. At state schools, departments like the College of Arts and Letters, Charter College of Education and the College of Natural and Social Sciences make unique individual awards.

Annual funding exceeds $10 Million system-wide, so awards can rise to $5000 for each qualified student. California State administers dozens of merit-based memorial awards through endowments funded by William Randolph Hearst and other noted luminaries.

## Scholarship And Grant Programs In Kentucky

## Feeling a Little Broke Before Class?

The state of Kentucky has established an agency called the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/home) (KHEAA) to administer the state's financial aid programs and provide helpful advice to Kentucky college students about planning and managing their college careers. KHEAA has improved its website design recently to make it even easier to find the information you need about available grants and scholarships.

Kentucky, through KHEAA, currently offers three grants and seven scholarships, all of which are discussed below.

<!-- image -->

## Gift Scholarships

## Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship

The Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/kees?main=1) (KEES) offers four different monetary awards scaled to your high school GPA or your test scores. Here are the ranges for those four types of award, as of 2012:

- The high school GPA award, $125 for a 2.5 to $500 for a 4.0.
- Awards for the ACT or an equivalent score on the SAT, between $36 for a score of 15 and $500 for a 28 or above.

- The Advanced Placement exam, which brings $200 for a 3, $250 for a 4, and $300 for a 5. This award goes only to students who were eligible for a discount on lunch at any time during high school.
- The International Baccalaureate exam, also for discounted-lunch students, starts at $200 for a 5 and goes up to $300 for a 7.

You do not need to apply for KEES. Your high school forwards your grades and scores, and KHEAA pays your college directly.

## Mary Jo Young Scholarship

The Mary Jo Young Scholarship (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/mjyoung?main=1) goes to Kentucky residents who take dual credit courses at Kentucky schools. The most given for tuition is $810 for two courses, and for textbooks used in those two courses, you will receive $250.

## Scholarships For Service

## For Teachers

Kentucky has three such scholarships available. The Teacher Scholarship Program (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/teacher?main=1) and the Minority Educator Recruitment and Retention Scholarship (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/convloan\_merr?main=1) give a maximum of $5,000 each year to students seeking a first certification as a teacher. For the Minority award, students must belong to an ethnic minority and have a 2.75 GPA, and the Teacher award requires financial need.

You must be a U. S. citizen living in Kentucky, and maintain satisfactory progress while enrolled full-time in a teacher education program. Your service requirement entails teaching for one semester in Kentucky in exchange for each semester of aid. If you cannot finish your degree program and service obligation, you will need to repay the award.

The Early Childhood Development Scholarship (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/ecds?main=1) is for students pursuing any of several degrees:

- The  Child  Development  Associate  Credential,  which  is  standard  for  teachers  in  early  childhood  education (ECE).
- An ECE associate degree.
- A bachelors degree in an ECE specialization approved by the Early Childhood Development Authority.
- An Early Childhood Development Director's Certificate from the state of Kentucky.

This scholarship is also given in return for service, and it is worth as much as $1,800 a year. To qualify, you must be enrolled part-time, meaning no more than 9 hours, in your degree program, and work at least 20 hours each week at a type of employment approved by the state (for instance, working as a preschool associate teacher in a state-funded preschool is acceptable).

## For Doctors

The Osteopathic Medicine Scholarship Program (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/osteo?main=1) helps students enrolled in the University of Pikeville's Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine (KCOM). You must be both a U. S. citizen and a resident of Kentucky, and the amount of the award is calculated by subtracting average in-state tuition at a Kentucky medical school from tuition at KCOM.

The service requirement consists of working in Kentucky for a year in a qualifying field for each year of financial aid, and if you fail to do that, your scholarship money must be repaid.

## Grants

The state of Kentucky offers three grants, all reserved for Kentucky residents who can demonstrate financial need on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Applicants for all three grants must be in good standing in terms of any money owed KHEAA or a federal Title IV student aid program, and no overdue debt is acceptable.

Here are details on the three grant programs:

- The College Access Program Grant (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/cap?main=1) (CAP Grant) is for students  enrolled  in  educational  programs  that  last  at  least  two  years  who  attend  school  half-time  at minimum, and awards are for as much as $1,900.CAP Grants are not prioritized but handed out as recipients qualify, so make sure you apply to the program as soon as possible every year.
- The  Kentucky  Tuition  Grant  (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/ktg?main=1)  is  awarded  to  full-time students  at  participating  Kentucky  private  colleges.  You  must  enroll  in  an  associate  or  bachelors  degree program and attend school full-time. The maximum Kentucky Tuition Grant is $3,000.
- The Go Higher Grants (https://www.kheaa.com/website/kheaa/gohighergrant?main=1) support students who are at least 24 years old and enrolled half-time. You must be a U. S. citizen, national, or permanent resident pursuing a first undergraduate degree.

## Other Scholarships And Grants For Kentucky Students

The two other sets of resources are federal financial aid and assistance offered by individual Kentucky schools. The U. S. Department of Education has a gateway page (http://studentaid.ed.gov/node/4/#aid-from-the-federalgovernment) where you can start your federal search, and individual federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offer their own scholarships and grants.

There is more information about federal grants on this page (https://www.collegescholarships.org/grants/federal.htm).

The financial aid office at your college or university will post a page of financial resources available for students, and you can also consult your own contacts in your particular academic department. The University of Kentucky's scholarship (http://www.uky.edu/financialaid/scholarships) page is a good example of what you will find on a school's website.

Research shows that the average Georgia student has more than $40,000 in student loans, making it the third most indebted state in the country. If you're a Georgia student attending college soon or are already enrolled, you should be looking for ways to make college more affordable.

One way to reduce your debt is to apply for more scholarships, especially Georgia-specific scholarships. Scholarships can reduce how much you have to pay for tuition, room and board, textbooks and other college costs.

Keep reading to learn more about Georgia scholarships, including where to find them, how to apply and how many different kinds there are.

## What is a Georgia scholarship?

A Georgia scholarship is an award given to a student who is either from Georgia or is attending college in Georgia. Like all types of scholarships, Georgia scholarships do not have to be paid back after you graduate or leave school.

Georgia scholarships may be either merit- or need-based, depending on the particular scholarship and its funding organization. Some scholarships may not look at the student's finances at all, while others will consider both grades and financial need.

For example, the Greenhouse Scholars Whole Person Scholarship requires that students have a 3.5 GPA or higher and also that their family earns less than $80,000 per year. Students must also be from Georgia, California, Colorado, Illinois, New York or North

Carolina. Only high school seniors are eligible to apply, and they must attend a four-year school. The scholarship is worth $5,000 per year for four years total.

Some Georgia scholarships will cover the entire cost of tuition. However, most will only cover a portion of costs. If you apply to several different scholarships, you may be able to significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.

## Where to find Georgia scholarships

There are many different places where you can find Georgia scholarships. Many Georgia scholarships come directly from the school you plan to attend, especially if you're attending school in-state. Most state schools have a special list of scholarships for local students to encourage them to stay.

Like with other scholarships, you can also search Google for 'Georgia scholarships.' If you go this route, try narrowing your search beyond just general state scholarships. For example, if you're from Decatur, Georgia, look for 'Decatur Georgia scholarships.' This will result in a smaller list of scholarships that you might be better qualified for, potentially maximizing your chances of winning an award.

You can find Georgia scholarships through major sites, like Scholarships.com, which has a robust awards directory. If you sign up for an account, you will be notified when a new scholarship is posted that you're a good candidate for.

Scholarships can come from either nonprofit or for-profit companies. Local organizations often provide local scholarships to area students. For example, the GLA Hubbard Scholarship is sponsored by the Georgia Library Association. This one-time $3,000 award is given to a student who is a resident of Georgia studying Library Sciences.

## How to apply for Georgia scholarships

One of the first steps is to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Most students think that the FAFSA is only necessary if they want to apply for federal student loans, but many scholarship applications also require the FAFSA. If you fill out the FAFSA, you are not required to take out federal student loans.

Another bonus? If you submit the FAFSA, you'll also be in the running for federal grants like the Pell Grant. There's no reason not to submit the FAFSA, unless you're not eligible to do so.

Students should also complete the Georgia State Financial Application (GSFAPP). The GSFAPP gives you access to a variety of different scholarships, including the HOPE and Zell Miller awards. These are significant state-based scholarships that can help students who are attending school within the state.

Scholarships from third-party organizations and companies often have their own application, but may also require the FAFSA or the GSFAPP. When applying for a scholarship or grant, make sure you understand which documents are required.

Both high school and college students can apply for Georgia scholarships. In fact, there are many awards for current college students. Don't make the mistake of assuming that you can only apply for a scholarship if you're an incoming freshman.

To qualify for all possible scholarships, make sure to submit the FAFSA or the GSFAPP by the school's and the state's financial aid deadline. For the 2024-25 school year, Georgia's deadline is as soon as possible after December 31, 2023. If you're attending school in a different state, they may have a different deadline.

## Georgia Scholarship Frequently Asked Questions

In a state the size of Georgia, there are countless types of scholarships that students can qualify for. Here are some of the most common questions that students and families have about scholarships.

## Do you have to attend a public school in Georgia to get a Georgia scholarship?

Some scholarships have rules on the type of school you must attend to qualify. In many cases, you must be attending a four-year school. However, the type of school - public or private - usually doesn't matter as much.

Students who are attending a private college can apply for the Georgia Tuition Equalization Grant Program (GTEG). This is a grant that is given to a student attending a private college

in Georgia instead of a public school.

The award is $500 per semester, and students can receive funding for up to three semesters per year. If you're interested in this scholarship, you can find a list of eligible schools here.

## Are there Georgia scholarships for certain minority groups?

While many Georgia scholarships are available to students from all types of backgrounds, others are more selective. If you're part of any kind of minority group, you may be able to find special Georgia scholarships just for you.

For example, the Black Alumni Scholarship at the University of Georgia is given to an African-American student who is attending UGA. There is a 3.0 minimum GPA requirement to both receive and maintain the scholarship. The scholarship is worth $2,000 per year and can be renewed for three years.

UGA also sponsors the Diversity Scholarship, which is worth $2,500. Students must be part of an underrepresented group and must also meet two of the following:

- Have a history of overcoming unique challenges
- Be a first-generation college student
- Come from a low-income family
- Live in a rural or inner-city location
- Have been raised by a single parent

## Do you have to attend school in Georgia to win a Georgia scholarship?

When you're applying for a Georgia scholarship, make sure you read through all the application requirements and confirm that you meet them. If you're from Georgia but not attending school in the state, check that you still qualify for the scholarship.

For example, the Watson-Brown Foundation Scholarship is only given to a student from certain counties in Georgia or South Carolina. However, they can attend school in any state,

as long as the institution is regionally accredited. This is a perfect example of a scholarship that is available to many Georgia students, but still has strict eligibility rules.

## Do you have to be from Georgia to win a Georgia scholarship?

Some Georgia scholarships require that students attend school in Georgia and also be official state residents.

For example, the HOPE Scholarship has strict residency requirements. Students may have to provide proof that they are a Georgia resident, which is determined by their school. Also, they must attend one of the approved Georgia-based colleges to qualify for the award.

If you receive one of these scholarships and later decide to transfer to a school out of state, you will lose your scholarship eligibility. The scholarship amount is also partly determined by the amount of credit hours as well as the school they're attending.

## How can I maintain my eligibility for a Georgia scholarship?

Many scholarships are only given on a one-time basis, but some can be renewed for multiple years. If your scholarship can be renewed, you must usually meet specific criteria, like maintaining a certain minimum GPA or taking enough credit hours every semester.

For example, the HOPE Scholarship has a 3.0 GPA requirement for initial eligibility and for maintaining your eligibility. If your GPA falls below that number, then you will lose your award.

## Are there scholarships for students from specific Georgia counties or cities?

While some Georgia scholarships are available for any student from the Peach State, others are more selective. They may require that you live or be from a certain Georgia city or county.

For example, the Next Step to Success Scholarship is given to a student from Sandy Springs, Georgia. Students must already be enrolled in a two-year or four-year school and meet other specific requirements.

The PHADA Scholarship Program is designed to help students who live in a housing program sponsored by the Public Housing Authority Directors Association (PHADA). There are three specific scholarships available for students, ranging from $5,000 to $7,000.

## Are Georgia scholarships available for community college students?

Community college students who are from Georgia or attending a two-year school in Georgia can still qualify for scholarships and grants, just like those at four-year schools.

Community college, technical and vocational schools have their own financial aid departments that can help you apply for all possible awards. The HOPE Grant is available for students who are getting a certificate or diploma. This is different from the HOPE Scholarship.

Also, the HOPE Career Grant is given to students majoring in a field that is underfilled in the state of Georgia. Students must attend one of these eligible colleges to qualify.

## Are Georgia scholarships available for graduate or professional students?

A popular myth says that only undergraduate students are eligible for scholarships. Fortunately, this isn't true. There are plenty of awards for graduate and professional school students.

Also, students who are not from Georgia may still qualify for scholarships for graduate or professional school. For example, the University of Georgia School of Law offers Tuition Equalization Scholarships for non- Georgia residents. This scholarship is essentially a tuition waiver, so they can receive the in-state tuition rate.

## Are there specific Georgia scholarships for certain majors or degrees?

Some Georgia scholarships are open to students who are studying any subject, but others are more limited.

For example, the Georgia Engineering Foundation offers scholarships for students who are studying engineering, construction management and engineering technology. Only

students who are Georgia residents are eligible to apply. However, they are not required to attend school in Georgia. Undergraduate, graduate and PhD students can apply.

## Can I get a Georgia scholarship if I'm an international student?

If you're a foreign student attending or applying to a school in Georgia, you can still qualify for certain grants and scholarships. These can reduce the cost of tuition and make it easier to fund your education.

For example, Georgia College &amp; State University offers a scholarship that is worth either a full tuition waiver or a partial tuition waiver for international students. This scholarship requires both merit and demonstrated financial need.

There may also be international scholarships for transfer students. Again, this will depend on the institution itself. Your best bet as an international student is to look for schools that offer tuition waivers.

## North Dakota Financial Aid Choices

## Have You Considered Every Funding Resource?

The state of North Dakota has found a useful way to organize their information on student financial aid, by collecting it on the website belonging to the North Dakota University System. One page (http://www.ndus.nodak.edu/students/paying-for-college/grants-scholarships/) contains information on scholarships, the state's one grant program, and loan forgiveness. That page also includes a number of links describing the university system itself, to help you select a school or transfer between schools.

You can also find assistance in financing and planning for your college career.

## Scholarships From The State Of North Dakota

The state has established four scholarship programs for North Dakota students attending North Dakota schools, including special help for members of local Indian tribes.

## North Dakota Academic Scholarships

The North Dakota Academic Scholarships were designed by the state legislature to provide an incentive for high school students to choose more challenging course alternatives. The most you can obtain through this program is $6,000 for all four years of school, distributed in increments of $750 per semester. If you are enrolled full-time and your GPA stays at 2.75, as a minimum, you can renew the award.

Full-time enrollment is defined as a minimum of twelve credits in the first two semesters of school and fifteen credits during each following semester.

To apply, you must be a senior in a North Dakota high school with a GPA of at least 3.0 in the particular set of courses required for this program, and a score of 24 on the ACT (http://www.dpi.state.nd.us/resource/act/act.shtm). Your high school counselor can tell you which courses to take, and the annual ACT deadline is currently February 12.

## North Dakota Career &amp; Technical Education Scholarships

Interestingly, the North Dakota Career &amp; Technical Education Scholarships are described in precisely the same manner as the Academic awards, with one major distinguishing feature: you must score either a 24 on the ACT or three 5s on the WorkKeys tests, which are vocational assessments. As you might suspect, the underlying difference in the two types of scholarships lies in the two sets of courses (http://www.dpi.state.nd.us/resource/act/info\_scholarship.pdf) required in high school.

To qualify for the Academic scholarships, you must take the following courses:

- English and Language Arts, including courses in literature, composition, and speech (4 units).
- Mathematics: one unit of Algebra II, one course for which Algebra II is required, and a third unit.
- Science: one unit each of biology and physical science plus a third unit.
- Social  studies:  A  total  of  three  units.  Must  include  one  unit  each  of  U.  S.  History,  social  science,  and democracy studies. For the democracy course, you may substitute a half-unit of U. S. Government plus a halfunit of economics.
- Physical  education:  one  unit,  taken  solely  in  physical  education  or  divided  between  physical  education  and health.
- One foreign language, or Native American language, or sign language (two units).
- One  unit,  and  you  may  choose  among  foreign  languages,  Native  American  languages,  American  Sign Language, fine arts, or Career and Technical Education.

One of the subjects listed above must be fulfilled by taking an advanced placement examination, or you may exchange a half-unit requirement by taking a dual credit course. Requirements for the Career awards are very similar, with these exceptions:

- Mathematics includes one unit of Algebra II and two units of your choice.
- Two  units  from  one  of  the  vocational  study  plans  (http://www.nd.gov/cte/programs/career-dev/plans-ofstudy.html),  which  currently  cover  the  following  fields:  agriculture,  business  and  office  work,  consumer education, health, information technology, marketing, engineering, and trade/industry.

## North Dakota Indian Scholarships

The state of North Dakota currently offers between 150 and 175 North Dakota Indian Scholarships to students formally enrolled in the state's federally recognized Indian tribes (http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/tribal/listof-federal-and-state-recognized-tribes.aspx#nd). Annual amounts vary between $800 and $2,000, and a GPA of 2.0 is required. You must attend school full-time to be eligible.

## North Dakota Scholars Program

The North Dakota Scholars Program pays full tuition for academically superior North Dakota high school graduates who pursue their undergraduate education in-state. If you maintain a GPA of 3.5, you can renew the scholarship for three years while attending any private or tribal college. If you choose a private school, the amount you receive equals the average tuition charged at the public research universities.

To apply, you must be a junior in high school and score in the upper fifth percentile of all the ACT tests taken in North Dakota, meaning the required score can vary every year.

## Other Financial Aid From The State Of North Dakota

## North Dakota State Student Incentive Grant Program

The North Dakota State Student Incentive Grant Program goes to first-time undergraduates, brings as much as

$1,500 each year, and require you to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/) (FAFSA). You must attend school full-time, meeting the satisfactory academic progress standard, and you can find all essential details on how the grant program works here (http://www.ndus.edu/makers/procedures/ndus/default.asp?PID=277&amp;SID=57).

Note: Te receive priority consideration, you must apply by April 15.

## Science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics (STEM) Occupations Student Loan Program

The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Occupations Student Loan Program

(http://www.ndus.edu/makers/procedures/ndus/default.asp?PID=312&amp;SID=57) is oddly named, since it's a loan forgiveness program targeted at paying off student loan debt in exchange for working in an approved STEM field somewhere in North Dakota. You must have graduated with a 2.5 GPA, earned a degree in the field in which you work, and not be in default on the loan for which you're seeking forgiveness.

Like the state's scholarships, you can receive a cumulative total of $6,000, at an annual rate of $1,500.

## Teacher Shortage Loan Forgiveness Program

The Teacher Shortage Loan Forgiveness Program (http://www.ndus.edu/makers/procedures/ndus/default.asp? PID=306&amp;SID=57) benefits teachers who agree to work in teacher shortage areas in North Dakota. That can mean either a grade level or an academic subject experiencing a dearth of teachers, and both are designated by the Department of Public Instruction. You can receive as much as $1,000 each year, for three years at most.

Note: Your years of teaching must be consecutive.

## Are College Bills Breaking Your Budget?

## Consider Grant and Scholarship Money in Michigan

One of the more frequently overlooked sources of grants and scholarships for college-bound students is their own state government. The majority of state legislatures regularly earmark funds for programs that are designed to support the educational ambitions of the state's residents. The state government of Michigan sponsors a variety of grant and scholarship programs dedicated to helping students find the money they need to pay for their college education. These programs are administered by the Student Financial Aid Department (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid) of the State of Michigan,  (http://www.michigan.gov/) and are open to all qualifying students who reside within the state. As with all state supported college financial aid, programs are subject to change according to the availability of funding.

<!-- image -->

## The FAFSA

Before applying for any state supported financial aid, college-bound students must first fill out and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/). The FAFSA is used to determine a student's eligibility for student aid. The information students supply on their FAFSA is used to generate a personal Student Aid Report (http://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report) which describes in detail the level of Federal and state supported financial aid for which the student has qualified. The FAFSA is also used by most

colleges, universities, and privately funded grant and scholarship programs to determine eligibility for awards. College-bound students should make submitting their FAFSA priority number one in their search for college funding.

## General Scholarships and Grants

Michigan's state government supports a wide variety of general scholarships and grants designed to encourage and support the continuing education of its resident students. These programs are a combination of need-based and merit-based awards, and offer varying amounts of financial support. Programs are subject to change without notice, and students in the Great Lakes State are encourage to monitor the government's Student Financial Aid Website (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid) to stay informed as to the status of available grants and scholarships.

The following general grants and scholarships are currently being supported by the government of the great state of Michigan:

- The Michigan Tuition Grant (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274564-,00.html)  -  The  MTG  was  established  in  1966  to  provide  residents  of  Michigan  with  increased  access  to higher education. The grant is available to undergraduate students who are attending, or preparing to enroll, at a non-profit state college or university. Award amounts vary, and are determined on the basis of financial need.
- The  Michigan  Competitive  Scholarship  (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274563--,00.html) - The MCS is available to undergraduate students who are pursuing their first degree at a state supported college or university. To be eligible, students must meet the requisite level of financial need and academic merit. Applicants must achieve a qualifying ACT score to be eligible for any scholarship award.
- The Tuition Incentive Program (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274565-,00.html) - This program was established in 1987 to encourage high school students to stay in school by providing tuition assistance for their first two years of college. Eligible students must apply to the program while attending high school. Tuition assistance is given to qualifying high school graduates who are pursuing an associate degree or approved certification at a state college, university or technical school. Award amounts vary, and are determined on the basis of financial need.
- The  GEAR  UP  Michigan  Scholarship  (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274567--,00.html) - The GEAR UP Scholarship Program is subsidized by the Federal government, and targets students within the three major urban public school systems within Michigan : Detroit, Flint and Muskegon. GEAR UP recipients must complete the six year GEAR UP Scholarship program, must be under 22 years of age, and must be enrolled in a participating state college or university.
- The GEAR UP College Day Scholarship (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274568--,00.html)  -  This  program  is  also  subsidized  by  the  Federal  government,  and  is  designed  to encourage and support low income students to pursue a college education. GUCD recipients must complete a six year GUCD Scholarship program, must be high school graduates, and must be enrolled at least part time at a participating state college or university. Award amounts vary, and are determined on the basis of financial need and academic merit.

## Grants for Students in Special Circumstances

In addition to the general grants and scholarships supported by the government of the great state of Michigan, two student specific grants are available to provide financial assistance to those in special circumstances. These programs target the dependent children of veterans and emergency response personnel.

The two state supported grants currently being offered to resident students in Michigan are:

- The Children of Veterans Tuition Grant (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274566--,00.html)  -  The  CVTG  is  designed  to  provide  undergraduate  tuition  assistance  to  the  natural  or adoptive  children  of  Michigan's  military  veterans.  Eligible  students  may  receive  up  to  four  years  of  tuition assistance  totaling  no  more  than  $11,200.  Students  must  be  full  time  residents  of  Michigan,  and  must  be attending a state supported college or university.
- The Police and Fire Fighter's  Survivors  Tuition  Grant  (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274569--,00.html)  -  This  program  provides  tuition  waivers  for  the  dependent  children  and spouses of Michigan police officers and firefighters who have been killed in the line of duty. To be eligible,

students must be the spouse or the natural or adoptive child of a deceased police officer or firefighter. Awards are made on the basis of available funds.

## Career Specific Financial Aid

Many states offer financial aid to students who are pursuing careers in certain high need professions. Michigan is currently suffering from a shortage of qualified teachers. As a way to encourage students to pursue teaching as a career, Michigan's state government sponsors the Michigan State Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program (http://www.michigan.gov/mistudentaid/0,4636,7-128-60969\_61016-274570--,00.html). This is an award-forservice program that provides loan forgiveness for certified teachers who agree to teach at a low income school for a minimum of five consecutive years. Eligible applicants may receive up to $17,500 in loan forgiveness to be put towards the principal and interest on their Federal Direct student loans. Further information can be found at the Federal Student Aid Website (http://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/teacher) of the U.S. Department of Education.

Resident students of the Great Lakes State have access to a wide variety of valuable financial aid programs supported by the Michigan state government. These programs were developed to encourage more students to pursue a post-secondary eduction. Michigan's state legislature understands that a growing economy depends on a well educated populace, and every year they support grants, scholarships and loan forgiveness programs designed to encourage and support resident students who are pursuing a college education.

## College Aid Programs In New Jersey

## Find Cash for Your Higher Education Expenses

New Jersey educational policy is proactive about higher education; providing need-based scholarships and grants to college students within the state. Outstanding institutions like Princeton (http://www.princeton.edu/main/) and Rutgers are emblematic of the State's rich academic tradition, which includes more than 60 private, public and community colleges. New Jersey universities grant campus-specific financial aid, and private benefactors fund education initiatives that provide aid for diverse student groups studying at all levels.

The bottom line for New Jersey university, community college and junior college students:  Financial aid is available to help pay for college.

The path to financial aid in New Jersey is similar to the one followed by students in other states, and starts with an application for federal aid.  The Free Application for Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA (http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/)) gathers data about your family finances, and your ability to pay for college.  The Department of Education uses the information to determine how much aid the government can provide for your higher education expenses.  States also use FAFSA entries to qualify applicants for state-specific programs, so make sure to submit your completed FAFSA prior to the New Jersey state filing deadline.

## New Jersey State Scholarships and Grants

The State of New Jersey (http://www.state.nj.us/nj/education/aid/) administers student assistance programs that benefit college students at public and private institutions of higher learning.  Grants, loans and other educational assistance recognizes need and achievement among the State's post-secondary degree candidates. Campus financial aid offices help match New Jersey students with the best college funding available, which includes state-sponsored aid issued by the New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (http://www.hesaa.org/Pages/StudentsParents.aspx) (HESSA)

## State Institutional Grants

Disengaged Adults Returning to College Grant Program benefits students over the age of 20 who are returning to higher education following an interruption.  State colleges are awarded funds; which they distribute as campus aid, under this three-year initiative.

Dual Enrollment Initiative Grants enable students to enroll in college-level course while they are still completing their high school graduation requirements.  Institutions accepting the award use funds to facilitate staffing and logistical requirements for participating students.

FAFSA Completion Grants are issued by the state, to individual colleges.  Because New Jersey relies on timelyfiled FAFSA applications to determine state financial aid awards, this assistance is granted to help facilitate accurate returns.

## NJ Gear Up

## (http://www.nj.gov/highereducation/gearup/index.html) strives to

increase access to higher education for minority and low income students.  Funded by the U.S. Department of Education and administered by New Jersey Higher Education, the program provides tutoring, mentoring and counseling for secondary students who are working toward college enrollment.  Gear Up issues its own scholarships

(http://www.nj.gov/highereducation/gearup/scholarship.htm) to program participants annually.

## State Student Grants

## Tuition Aid Grants

(http://www.hesaa.org/Pages/TuitionAidGrant.aspx) (TAG) are issued according to need, cost of attendance and available funding.  Grant amounts may not exceed total cost of attendance. Students who receive TAG funds are eligible to reapply as long as specific program requirements are maintained.  To qualify for New Jersey Tuition Aid Grants, applicants must:

## The Educational Opportunity Fund

(http://www.hesaa.org/Pages/EOFGrant.aspx) benefits low income applicants within the state, who receive grants designed to increase access to higher education among economically

- Demonstrate financial need
- Be U.S. citizens
- Be minimum 1-year New Jersey residents prior to applying
- Register with Selective Service
- Exhibit satisfactory academic progress, as determined by individual school standards
- Enroll full-time
- Pursue undergraduate degrees
- Enroll in approved programs
- Be in pursuit of first degree

disadvantaged groups.  Grants are valued between $200 and $2500 each, based on the specific costs of attendance and household income parameters.  Eligibility mirrors TAG requirements, with additional financial need present.

High achievers qualify for state-sponsored scholarships when they finish in the upper 15% of their high school classes.  College placement scores are also used to qualify students who meet the standard scholastic requirements.  Scholarships cover the cost of tuition, less any other financial aid a student receives.

The Part Time Tuition Aid Grant (http://www.hesaa.org/Pages/Part-TimeTAGforCountyCollegeStudents.aspx)for County College Students targets those enrolled for between 6-11 credit hours at New Jersey County Colleges (http://www.njccc.org/).

(http://www.hesaa.org/Documents/12WTC\_ScholarshipAPP\_REVISED.pdf) Fund was established following the terrorist attacks of 9-11-2001.  The state of New Jersey was impacted disproportionately due to its proximity to the attacks, so dependant children and surviving spouses are eligible for educational aid under the program.

## Campus-Speficic Aid for New Jersey Students

The Seton Hall Office of Admissions (http://www.shu.edu/applying/undergraduate/scholarships.cfm) lists several financial aid resources that are available to students each school year.  Scholarships offered on-campus target students in particular programs, and provide assistance to candidates with diverse backgrounds.  These examples illustrate the range of aid put-forth by campus financial aid administrators:

Alumni Scholarship - Children, grandchildren and siblings of Seton Hall graduates are invited to apply for meritbased awards that consider each applicant's academic record and commitment to Seton Hall's values.

Chicago Alumni Memorial Scholarships target Illinois residents who need help meeting Seton Hall tuition costs.  Illinois residents who possess GPAs of at least 3.0 and SAT scores of at least 1650 are invited to apply for these annual awards.  Scholarships are valued at $1000 each, but are renewable.  In addition to scholastic aptitude, financial need - based on FAFSA results - influences who receives assistance.

Dan Barney Awards benefit applicants from select Midwestern states, who maintain high academic standards. Cumulative GPA requirements of 3.0 must be met by eligible applicants, as well attaining high scores on college placement exams (1650 SAT and 23 ACT).

Princeton University (http://www.princeton.edu/admission/financialaid/how\_it\_works/) estimates that the cost of attending the prestigious college exceeds $50,000 annually.  To increase access to high quality education for low and middle income families, the University has adopted a need-based financial aid strategy that meets 100% of the financial requirements of each accepted student.  Qualified applicants are encouraged to seek enrollment, regardless of their ability to pay. On-campus diversity is promoted by admissions policies that do not consider financial conditions.  In 2001, the university became one of the first institutions of higher learning to commit to educational financing that is entirely grant-based, allowing students to emerge from Princeton programs debtfree.  For some, Princeton financial aid packages include part-time campus jobs that help offset the cost of attendance.
