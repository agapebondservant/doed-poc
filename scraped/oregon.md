### Oregon Barber and Hairdresser (B&amp;H) Grant Program

Who can apply?

You must be a resident of Oregon who is attending or will attend a licensed school of barbering, hair design, cosmetology, or manicure in Oregon that    participates in Federal Title IV financial aid programs. You must enroll full-time in a program which is at least nine months long or 900 clock hours. You    must have a significant need for financial help.

### Chafee Education and Training Grant

Eligibility for the Chafee Grant

Foster youth have hopes and dreams of a successful future just like other young people who have graduated or obtained their GED. The only difference is    that many foster youth don't have a family to fall back on for assistance. The State of Oregon and the federal government are helping support foster youth    who wish to continue their education and training after high school.

The Department of Human Services (DHS) Independent Living Program (ILP) has received Chafee Education and Training Voucher (ETV) funding to help current or    former foster care youth with postsecondary education and training.

Youth may be eligible to receive up to $3,000* per academic year. To be eligible, you must:

1. Currently be in foster care, or
2. Had been in foster care for at least 180 days (six months) after your 14th birthday and  exited substitute care at age 16 or older
3. Be participating in the voucher program on your 21st birthday***. Youth may then continue to apply/receive funds until they turn 23 years old as long        as they are enrolled in a post secondary education or training program and making satisfactory progress toward completion of that program.

* $3,000 is the maximum amount available to youth each academic year. The actual maximum amount will be determined by the date that the Application is    received and the unmet need of the applicant (see Application Deadlines for specifics).    
    **Foster care placement must have been with either Oregon's DHS child welfare (formerly SCF), or one of the nine federally recognized Tribes in Oregon. If    you reside outside of Oregon, were never in foster care in Oregon, and will be attending school in your home state or another state outside of Oregon,    please contact the Chafee program within your home state.    
    *** If a youth's 21st birthday falls outside the regular school dates (i.e. summer term), then we will look at the term prior to the student's    21&lt;sup&gt;st birthday to verify that the student was receiving ETV funds on their 21st birthday

### JOBS Plus Program

The Individual Education Account (IEA) was created as a section of Ballot Measure 7 passed by a vote of the people of Oregon in 1990. The measure created    the JOBS Plus Program. The statute (ORS 411.894(1)) states "The Oregon JOBS Plus Individual Education Account is established in order to improve the    position of JOBS Plus participants in the workforce by increasing their access to continuing education." Since then, thousands of people have participated    in the JOBS Plus Program and have benefited from the opportunity to further their education and work skills. 
Eligibility to participate in the JOBS Plus program is determined by the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS). Recipients of The Aid to Needy Families    (TANF) benefits and Food Stamps may qualify. To find out if you are eligible, please contact the office of the Oregon Department of Human Services closest    to your residence address. The Oregon Student Assistance Commission can not determine eligibility, and only works with the program after the participant    has completed their temporary job rotation and the Individual Education Account is transferred to us from DHS.
