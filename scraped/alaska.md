My Steps to Qualify for the APS

Work to achieve the highest GPA you can.
Prepare for and take an SAT and/or ACT practice test. Sign up to take the SAT and/or ACT early, so you can retake them if you want to better your score. List your high school as a recipient of your score. Also, see what your options are based on WorkKeys scores.
Research qualifying Alaska colleges and training programs and choose the one that's right for you. Apply early.
Log in to the  Alaska Student Aid Portal (ASAP) , and file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), as early as possible after January 1 the year you want to use the award. Check back in to  ASAP  regularly to review your status.
Don't forget to research other financial aid available to you.&lt;/li&gt;
