### Academic Common Market

In-State Tuition for Select Out-of-State Programs

ACM OVERVIEW

The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) and the state higher ed=
ucation agencies of the participating states =E2=80=93 Alabama, Arkansas, D=
elaware, Florida,    Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, N=
orth Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and We=
st Virginia =E2=80=93 administer    the Academic Common Market (ACM) progra=
m. The program operates on the premise that if public institutions (no priv=
ate institutions can participate) in a    student=E2=80=99s home state do n=
ot offer a degree program (undergraduate or graduate) that a student intend=
s on pursuing, then he/she may attend a participating    out-of-state insti=
tution offering the degree of interest and be granted a waiver of out-of-st=
ate tuition charges. This serves as a cost-saving measure for    both paren=
ts and students as in-state tuition rates are lower than out-of-state rates=
. It is also a savings to the Commonwealth, as these programs do not    hav=
e to be duplicated here in Virginia. Numerous undergraduate and graduate de=
gree programs are available to Virginia residents.
