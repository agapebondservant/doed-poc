The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Virginia.

### Academic Common Market

In-State Tuition for Select Out-of-State Programs

ACM OVERVIEW

The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) and the state higher education agencies of the participating states =E2=80=93 Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida,    Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia =E2=80=93 administer    the Academic Common Market (ACM) program. The program operates on the premise that if public institutions (no private institutions can participate) in a    student's home state do not offer a degree program (undergraduate or graduate) that a student intends on pursuing, then he/she may attend a participating    out-of-state institution offering the degree of interest and be granted a waiver of out-of-state tuition charges. This serves as a cost-saving measure for    both parents and students as in-state tuition rates are lower than out-of-state rates. It is also a savings to the Commonwealth, as these programs do not    have to be duplicated here in Virginia. Numerous undergraduate and graduate degree programs are available to Virginia residents.

Please go to website for all the information.

### Child Day Care Provider Scholarship Program

The Virginia Child Care Provider Scholarship Program is a tuition assistance program offering current and future child care providers a foundation in the    care and development of children. The program, funded through Virginia's share of the federal Child Care and Development Fund, provides assistance for    providers to attend courses at Virginia institutions of higher learning.

Courses required for a certificate or degree in the early childhood education field may be approved for payment through the VCCPSP, as funding allows. The    maximum benefits allowable for the Scholarship Program include either eight classes or a maximum lifetime award of $2,689.00, whichever comes first. The    scholarship award pays the cost of tuition and the technology fee for up to two courses per semester. Any additional fees for travel or expenses, such as    books and activity fees, are the responsibility of the student.

### The College Scholarship Assistance Program (CSAP)

The College Scholarship Assistance Program (CSAP) is a statewide need-based undergraduate grant program established in 1973 to assist students with extreme    financial need in Virginia's public and participating private colleges and universities. The Commonwealth combines state appropriations with the Federal    Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) to fund the program.

### Virginia Commonwealth Award Program

The purpose of the Virginia Commonwealth Award is to assist undergraduate students with financial need and graduate students to pay part of their college    costs. The funds are appropriated directly to each state-supported institution. Funds may be used for need-based grants to Virginia resident undergraduates    or for grants or assistantships to graduate students (both in-state and out-of-state). The law requires that the awards to undergraduates be proportional    to need so that the students with the greatest need receive the largest awards.

### The Tuition Grant Program for Foster Care and Special Needs Adoption Recipients

Tuition grants are available for foster youth, former foster youth, and special needs adoptees who have a high school diploma or GED.&lt;/p&gt;
 What is the program? 
    The Tuition Grant program provides tuition and fees at any Virginia community college for high school graduates or general education development (GED)    completers in foster care, in the custody of a social services agency, or considered a special needs adoption..

Virginia Space Grant Consortium

    In 1988, Congress enacted the NASA National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program to address scientific and technological workforce needs and the    national decline in scholastic achievement, especially in math and science. NASA's Space Grant funds education, research, and public service programs in    all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico through a network of 52 university-based Space Grant Consortia with over 800 participating    affiliates. The Space Grant Consortia is united by the common goal of developing the educational and economic benefits of aerospace research and    exploration.
    A major goal of the Virginia Space Grant Consortium (VSGC) is to help produce the engineers and scientists of the future. While opportunities for careers    in aerospace have expanded, the number of talented students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has declined. To    encourage talented individuals to pursue aerospace-related fields of study, the VSGC has established four Scholarship and Fellowship programs.
    The VSGC Scholarship and Fellowship Program annually awards approximately $300,000 to students pursuing higher education at Virginia Space Grant    universities            (College of William and Mary, Hampton University, Old Dominion University, University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech) and Virginia Community Colleges    . More information about each Scholarship program and a link to apply are below.    Information about Graduate STEM Research Fellowship opportunities can be viewed here.

Lee-Jackson Foundation Scholarships

    The Lee-Jackson Foundation of Charlottesville was founded in 1953 by the late Jay W. Johns, a successful Pennsylvania industrialist transplanted to    Virginia, who became a great admirer of Generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson. He believed that both these Americans possessed    distinguished traits of character that should be emulated by future generations.
    Since both these Virginians were involved in education, the Foundation honors them by working to increase educational opportunities for Virginia's youth.    The Foundation has traditionally focused on scholarships as the best vehicle to encourage high school students to continue their education, and sponsors an    annual essay competition to make its awards. Scholarships are given for outstanding essays which demonstrate an appreciation of the exemplary character and    soldierly virtues of Generals Lee and Jackson. Essays are judged with emphasis on historical accuracy, quality of research, and clarity of written    expression.
