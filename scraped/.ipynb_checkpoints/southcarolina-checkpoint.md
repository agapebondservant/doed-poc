GI BILL

  
    Legislation that provides money for veterans to pay for tuition and =

    Recipients can receive paid tuition and fees for public in-state =
schools, a living stipend and an allowance for books and supplies (around $=
1,000 per    year.)    
    Education benefits are also available for di=
sabled veterans, and survivors and dependents of veterans.    
    The P=
ost-9/11 GI Bill became effective on Aug. 1, 2009, and veterans who have se=
rved after Sept. 10, 2001, with at least 90 days of continuous service, are=
    eligible. The bill also gives Reserve and Guard members who have been a=
ctivated for more than 90 days since 9/11 access to the same benefits as ac=
tive-duty    soldiers.    
    You may also be eligible for a fee waiver=
 at a public college if you have financial need and are the child or depend=
ent of a service-connected disabled or    deceased veteran, or the recipien=
t or the child of a recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor.    
   =
 For more information, contact your college=E2=80=99s veteran affairs offic=
e or the local office of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs at (888) 44=
2-4551, or go    to gibill.va.gov.
LOANS
    (money you have to repay later)    
 Federal Perkins Loans    are made through participa=
ting schools to undergraduate, graduate and professional degree students, b=
oth full-time and part-time, who demonstrate financial    need. These parti=
cular loans are repaid to your school.    
 Stafford Loans    are for undergraduate, graduate a=
nd professional degree students. You must be enrolled as at least a half-ti=
me student to be eligible for a Stafford Loan.    Stafford Loans are either=
 subsidized and unsubsidized, meaning the government either pays the intere=
st during school or it doesn=E2=80=99t. Financial need is not a    requirem=
ent to obtain an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, but you are responsible for pa=
ying the interest that accrues on unsubsidized Stafford Loans.    
 PLUS Loans    (Direct or FFEL) are loans parents ca=
n obtain to help pay the cost of education for their dependent undergraduat=
e children. In addition, graduate and    professional degree students may o=
btain PLUS Loans to help pay for their own education.    
 Consolidation Loans    (Direct or FFEL) allow stude=
nt or parent borrowers to combine multiple federal education loans into one=
 loan with one monthly payment.

WORK-STUDY

  
    Every year, millions of students take advantage of the Federal Work-=
Study (FWS) program, holding down jobs both on-campus and off-campus. If yo=
u=E2=80=99re    eligible for work-study, a school will figure it in on your=
 financial aid award letter. Work-study is a great way to help pay for tuit=
ion, books, and room    and board =E2=80=94 and the possibilities are endle=
ss. You could take a service-related job at a local community center, or wo=
rk in an academic department at your    school. If you=E2=80=99re a night o=
wl, you could work a late shift in the library. If you=E2=80=99re an early =
riser, you could help serve breakfast in the student commons.    And while =
the total amount you make can=E2=80=99t exceed your work-study award for th=
e year, it=E2=80=99s smart to make the most you can. Work-study can also be=
 a good    distraction during a tough day of classes and studying. If work-=
study is part of your award, it means the money has already been set aside =
for you, so    don=E2=80=99t miss out. Get to work!
    The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program gives part-time jobs to undergr=
aduate and graduate students with financial need. You can work to make mone=
y to pay for    education expenses, including tuition, books, and room and =
board. If you are eligible, your college or university will include work-st=
udy in your financial    aid award letter.
    The FWS program encourages community service, as well as work relate=
d to what you=E2=80=99re studying in school. You=E2=80=99ll make at least t=
he current federal minimum    wage. Some earn more, but it depends on what =
you=E2=80=99re doing and what skills are required.
    Your total award will depend on when you apply, your level of financ=
ial need and the funding level of your school. If you=E2=80=99re an undergr=
aduate, you=E2=80=99ll be    paid by the hour. If you=E2=80=99re a graduate=
 student, you might receive a salary. Either way, your school must pay you =
at least once a month. Also, your school    must pay you directly.
    FWS jobs can be on or off campus. If you work on campus, you=E2=80=
=99ll usually work for your school. If you work off campus, you will usuall=
y work for a private    non-profit organization or a public agency. General=
ly, the work performed off campus must be in the public interest, which mea=
ns it must benefit some    portion of the general public.
    You can=E2=80=99t earn more than your total award. Also, when schedu=
ling your work, your employer or financial aid administrator will look at y=
our class schedule    and your academic progress to make sure you=E2=80=99r=
e keeping up in school and maintaining a good balance between work and stud=
y.
