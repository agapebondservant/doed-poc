### Cal Grant Programs

A Cal Grant is money for college you don't have to pay back. To qualify, you must apply for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or California Dream Act Application (CADAA) by the deadline and meet the eligibility and financial requirements as well as any minimum GPA requirements. Cal Grants can be used at any University of California, California State University or California Community College, as well as qualifying independent and career colleges or technical schools in California.

There are three kinds of Cal Grants =E2=80=94 A, B and C =E2=80=94 but you don't have to figure out which one to apply for. Your eligibility will be based on your FAFSA or CADAA responses, your verified Cal Grant GPA, the type of California colleges you list on your FAFSA and whether you're a recent high school graduate.

### California Chafee Grant for Foster Youth

If you are or were in foster care and have financial need, you may qualify for up to $5,000 a year for career and technical training or college. You don't    have to pay this money back. You may also be able to use your grant to help pay for child care, transportation and rent while you're in school. You can use    your Chafee Grant at any eligible California college or university or career or technical school, as well as schools in other states.

To qualify, you must be a current or former foster youth and not have reached your 22nd birthday as of July 1 of the award year. The court must have    established your dependency when you were between the ages of 16 and 18. (KinGap youth, adopted youth, guardian placement, and voluntary placement may not    be eligible for the Chafee Grant, unless court dependence was established, at anytime, between the ages of 16 and 18). The California Department of Social    Services will verify your foster youth eligibility status

### Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents Grant Program (LEPD)

The Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents Grant Program provides need-based educational grants to dependents and spouses of: California peace            officers (Highway Patrol, marshals, sheriffs, police officers), Department of Corrections and California Youth Authority employees, and            permanent/full-time firefighters employed by public entities who have been killed in the performance of duty or totally disabled as a result of an            accident or injury caused by external violence or physical force incurred in the performance of duty.

Grant awards match the amount of a Cal Grant award and range from $100 to $12,192 for up to four years.

Applications are accepted throughout the academic year.
