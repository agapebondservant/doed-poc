In 2007, The Idaho Legislature approved a $10 million dollar appropriation to start the Opportunity Scholarship fund. Governor Otter's goal is to grow that    corpus to approximately $100 million dollars, giving Idaho students and their families access to approximately $10 million dollars a year in actual    scholarship monies, funded entirely by interest earnings, thus eliminating any burden to the Idaho taxpaying public.

- You do not have to apply for all Idaho scholarships in order to apply for the Opportunity Scholarship. Students who are already in college, missed            the application deadline or choose to only apply for the Opportunity scholarship should follow Option 2.

- Option 2: Complete the Opportunity Scholarship application and the FAFSA prior to March 1.
