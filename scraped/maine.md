Medical Education Programs

Maine students may receive    help gaining admission to medical schools and veterinary schools participating in the Maine Access to Medical Education Program. Loans are also available    to Maine students pursuing a degree in dentistry, optometry and veterinary science.
    Health Professions Loan Program
    The Finance Authority of Maine also offers a forgivable loan program to Maine residents. Maine postgraduate health professions students are eligible to    borrow forgivable loans from FAME. Ninety percent of the funds available are set-aside for medical students; up to 10% of the funds may be awarded to other    health professions students. Maine students who gain entry to medical school as a preferred Access Program participant will have priority for need-based    loans ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 per year. The maximum loan amount for students not participating in the Access Program is $10,000. All loans will be    awarded on the basis of need. If you wish to borrow money from FAME, you must apply for financial aid through the normal channels required by the    institution you will be attending. The Director of Financial Aid at your school must provide FAME the amount of your estimated family contribution (EFC)    before any award can be made. For purposes of the Maine Health Professions Loan, parents' financial resources will not be included in the assessment of    financial need if applicants are age 30 or older or have been independent for financial aid purposes for at least 5 years. Applicants for this loan must    provide the financial information that is required by their individual school in assessing financial need. Loans do not accrue interest while in school,    residency fellowship or obligated service.

FAME pays a capitation fee of $12,000 to provide access to a student who expresses a serious interest in practicing large animal    veterinary care in an area of the State determined to be underserved. The $12,000 capitation fee is used to reduce tuition and is treated as a loan to the    student that is eligible for forgiveness if the student returns and practices large animal veterinary medicine in a designated underserved area in Maine.    Underserved areas are determined by the Commissioner of Agriculture.
