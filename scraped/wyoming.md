The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Wyoming.

### Adult Basic Education

Wyoming Adult Basic Education (ABE) focuses on strengthening basic reading, writing, and math skills for adults. Instruction for the General Education    Development (GED) Exam is offered. English as a Second Language (ESL) teaches English language skills to adults whose first language is not English. ESL    seeks to develop an understanding of American culture and society to facilitate effective citizenship

### Distance Education

Taking college classes is a worthwhile challenge. It's an even bigger challenge if you are working, not close to a college, or not close to an outreach    testing center.

Distance education courses may help you achieve your goal. Technology can bring education to your doorstep. It's definitely more convenient, even if    distance education classes require a lot of work.

The seven colleges in Wyoming offer a wide variety of distance education courses. The links to your right for each college will take you directly to the    Distance Education page on their web site.

### Even Start

Authorized through the Literacy Involves Families Together (LIFT) Act of 2000 and the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Even Start is an education program    for low-income families designed to improve the academic achievement of young children and their parents, especially in the area of reading. Even Start    offers promise for helping to break the cycle of poverty and low literacy by combining four core components:

- Early childhood education
- Adult literacy (adult basic and secondary-level education and/or instruction for English language learners)
- Parenting education
- Interactive literacy activities between parents and their children

Even Start supports family literacy services for parents with low literacy skills or limited English proficiency, and their children, primarily birth    through age seven. It contains three goals:

- To help parents improve their literacy or basic educational skills
- To help parents become full partners in educating their children
- To assist children in reaching their full potential as learners

Wyoming is home to five Even Start centers. They are located in Cheyenne, Gillette, Casper, Torrington and Worland. The centers are supported by a    combination of state and federal funds. The Wyoming Community College Commission, in partnership with the Wyoming Department of Education, administers the    program. Four of the centers, (Cheyenne, Casper, Torrington and Worland), are affiliated with the non-profit organization, NOWCAP of Wyoming. Gillette Even    Start is closely associated with Campbell County School District.

### Wyoming Hathaway Scholarship Program

The state of Wyoming established a generous scholarship program in the name of former Wyoming Governor Stan Hathaway that rewards eligible Wyoming students    with scholarship money to attend one of Wyoming's community colleges or the University of Wyoming.

The program provides merit- and need-based awards to eligible students. Merit Awards between $800 and $1,600 per semester are available to high school    graduates and others who are Wyoming residents and meet certain academic requirements. Need Awards above and beyond the Merit Awards are available to those    with unmet financial need as determined by your Financial Aid application (FAFSA),

The first eligible students will be from the high school graduating class of 2006, those who completed a home-based educational program or those who    completed a GED after April 1, 2006 .

Contact the community college of your choice for further detail on these exciting new scholarships, including eligibility requirements, award levels,    application processes, and frequently asked questions.

### Teacher Shortage Loan Repayment Program

The Wyoming Teacher Shortage Loan Repayment Program (TSLRP) was adopted by the 2005 Wyoming legislature. The goal of the program is to provide loans to    students who will stay in Wyoming after graduation and work as teachers.

The legislature provided funds to be used for students who are at least juniors at the University of Wyoming in the teacher education program leading to    certification in special education, mathematics or science. The funds are to assist with educational expenses as determined by the University of Wyoming    Office of Student Financial Aid. Completion of the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is necessary for consideration for the Wyoming Teacher Shortage Loan Program.

What should you do to be considered for a TSLRP loan?

The most important steps to take are these:

- Submit the application form.
- Begin the process of applying for federal financial aid at UW as soon as possible.
- Submit the application by the last Friday in April.

### Wyoming Workforce Alliance

Four years ago the Wyoming Business Council, the Department of Workforce Services and the Community College Commission formed the Wyoming Workforce    Alliance as a vehicle and process for meeting almost every month to assess and respond to the current and projected workforce needs in Wyoming. In the last    year, the Alliance has expanded to include the University of Wyoming and the Wyoming Department of Education in order to make our efforts even more    responsive and comprehensive. The Alliance's primary responsibility is to coordinate and support agencies and colleges in developing workforce initiatives    with a statewide impact. The Alliance also shares workforce-related information about high-skill, high-wage, or high demand occupations.

### Wyoming Investment in Nursing

The Wyoming Investment in Nursing (WYIN) originally adapted by the 2003 Wyoming legislature, was amended by the 2010 Legislature to continue until June 30,    2016. The funds are for students who are accepted into nursing programs at the University of Wyoming or one of the six Wyoming community colleges. The    funds are to assist with educational expenses as determined by the financial aid office at each academic institution. The need for financial assistance    through WYIN is based on a student applying for federal financial aid by completing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).

If you are interested in being considered for a WYIN loan, the first requirement is to be accepted into the nursing program offered by one of these    schools:

- Casper College (Casper)
- Central Wyoming College (Riverton)
- Laramie County Community College (Cheyenne)
- Northwest College (Powell)
- Sheridan College (Sheridan)
- Western Wyoming Community College (Rock Springs)
