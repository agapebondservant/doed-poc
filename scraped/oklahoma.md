Please go to this website for all the information about the different programs.

The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Oklahoma.

### Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant Program (OTAG)

OTAG is a need-based grant program for Oklahoma residents who attend approved colleges, universities and career technology centers in Oklahoma. Awards are approved for fulltime or part-time undergraduate students.

Application

Application is made through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) available online at www.fafsa.gov, through high school guidance counselors or the financial aid office at the college you are planning to attend. For best consideration, you should complete and submit the FAFSA to the federal student aid application system as soon as possible after Jan. 1 of your senior year. IT IS IMPORTANT TO APPLY EARLY. Typically, the OTAG program receives more eligible applications than can be awarded with available funds, and how early a student applies can be the deciding factor in whether that student is offered an OTAG award.

Eligibility

Financial need is measured by the Expected Family Contribution EFC), which is determined based on the information the student provides on their FAFSA. The maximum EFC eligible to receive OTAG may vary from year to year based on volume of eligible applications received and available state funding. The EFC appears on the Student Aid Report sent to students by the U.S. Department of Education once their FAFSA has been processed. An award will not be denied for academic reasons as long as the college's minimum requirements for admission are fulfilled and satisfactory academic  progress is made according to the school's policy for student financial aid recipients.

### Oklahoma's Promise (Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program)
  
    The Oklahoma Legislature created a scholarship program that will help pay for a student's education if his/her parents' total yearly     income is not more than $50,000 at the time of application and not  more than $100,000 at the time the student goes to college. That program is called Oklahoma's Promise.
 How It Works
    =E2=80=A2 Student must be an Oklahoma resident and enroll in the program in eighth, ninth or 10th grade (home-schooled students age 13, 14 or 15). Student starts early so he/she can get ready for college by taking high school courses that will help him/her do well.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must take certain courses and pass those courses with at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average. (See below for a full description of required curriculum.)
    =E2=80=A2 Student must achieve at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average for all courses in grades 9-12. Student must go to class regularly and do his/her homework.
    =E2=80=A2 Student also agrees to stay out of serious trouble and away from  drugs and alcohol.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the United States to receive the scholarship in college.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must meet additional financial, academic and conduct requirements to keep the scholarship after enrolling in college.
  
Academic Scholars Program
  
    The Academic Scholars Program was created and funded by the Oklahoma Legislature as an incentive for students of high academic ability to attend both public and private higher education institutions in Oklahoma. The program was created to enhance the academic environment, to retain academically talented students within Oklahoma and to attract others of equal talent to the state.
 Application
    Applications are available every October and can be obtained by contacting the State Regents' office. The applicant must qualify  prior to college entry.
 Eligibility
    Residents of Oklahoma automatically qualify by scoring within the 99.5 to 100.0 percentile levels on the ACT or SAT as administered in the state of Oklahoma. For students entering the program fall  2015, the minimum ACT sum of scores required is 133. The sum of scores required is subject to change each year. Students will need to contact the State Regents' office to verify the sum of scores required to qualify for the program. The test scores must be from a single national test date. Partial scores from more than one examination will not be considered.
    Residents also automatically qualify by achieving one of the following designations: National Merit Scholar, National Merit Finalist or United States Presidential Scholar. Nonresidents may qualify for the program by achieving designation as a National Merit Scholar, National Merit Finalist or United States Presidential Scholar. However, out-of-state student participation is limited, and  achieving such a designation does not automatically qualify students for the program.
 Institutional Nominee
    State public colleges and universities may nominate students attending their institutions for the Academic Scholars Program based on criteria established by each individual institution. Nominees will be selected through the normal admission and/or scholarship application at the institution.
