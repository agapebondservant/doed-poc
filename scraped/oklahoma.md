The following are financial aid programs available to students who a=
re residents of the state of Oklahoma.

### Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant Program (OTAG)

OTAG is a need-based grant program for Oklahoma residents who attend=
 approved colleges, universities and career technology centers in Oklahoma.=
 Awards are approved for fulltime or part-time undergraduate students.

Application

Application is made through the Free Application for Federal Student=
 Aid (FAFSA) available online at www.fafsa.gov, through hi=
gh school guidance counselors or the financial aid office at the college yo=
u are planning to attend. For best consideration, you should complete and s=
ubmit the FAFSA to the federal student aid application system as soon as po=
ssible after Jan. 1 of your senior year. IT IS IMPORTANT TO APPLY E=
ARLY. Typically, the OTAG program receives more eligible applicati=
ons than can be awarded with available funds, and how early a student appli=
es can be the deciding factor in whether that student is offered an OTAG aw=
ard.

Eligibility

Financial need is measured by the Expected Family Contribution EFC),=
 which is determined based on the information the student provides on their=
 FAFSA. The maximum EFC eligible to receive OTAG may vary from year to year=
 based on volume of eligible applications received and available state fund=
ing. The EFC appears on the Student Aid Report sent to students by the U.S.=
 Department of Education once their FAFSA has been processed. An award will=
 not be denied for academic reasons as long as the college=E2=80=99s minimu=
m requirements for admission are fulfilled and satisfactory academic  progr=
ess is made according to the school=E2=80=99s policy for student financial =
aid recipients.

### Oklahoma=E2=80=99s Promise (Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program)
  
    The Oklahoma Legislature created a scholarship program that will hel=
p pay for a student=E2=80=99s education if his/her parents=E2=80=99 total y=
early     income is not more than $50,000 at the time of application and no=
t  more than $100,000 at the time the student goes to college. That program=
 is called Oklahoma=E2=80=99s Promise.

    =E2=80=A2 Student must be an Oklahoma resident and enroll in the pro=
gram in eighth, ninth or 10th grade (home-schooled students age 13, 14 or 1=

 school courses that will help him/her do well.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must take certain courses and pass those courses w=
ith at least a 2.5 cumulative grade point average. (See below for a full de=

y from  drugs and alcohol.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must be a U.S. citizen or lawfully present in the =
United States to receive the scholarship in college.
    =E2=80=A2 Student must meet additional financial, academic and condu=

Academic Scholars Program
  
    The Academic Scholars Program was created and funded by the Oklahoma=

d both public and private higher education institutions in Oklahoma. The pr=
ogram was created to enhance the academic environment, to retain academical=
ly talented students within Oklahoma and to attract others of equal talent =
to the state.
 Application
    Applications are available every October and can be obtained by cont=
acting the State Regents=E2=80=99 office. The applicant must qualify  prior=
 to college entry.
 Eligibility
    Residents of Oklahoma automatically qualify by scoring within the 99=
.5 to 100.0 percentile levels on the ACT or SAT as administered in the stat=
e of Oklahoma. For students entering the program fall  2015, the minimum AC=
T sum of scores required is 133. The sum of scores required is subject to c=
hange each year. Students will need to contact the State Regents=E2=80=99 o=
ffice to verify the sum of scores required to qualify for the program. The =
test scores must be from a single national test date. Partial scores from m=
ore than one examination will not be considered.

ng designations: National Merit Scholar, National Merit Finalist or United =
States Presidential Scholar. Nonresidents may qualify for the program by ac=
hieving designation as a National Merit Scholar, National Merit Finalist or=
 United States Presidential Scholar. However, out-of-state student particip=
ation is limited, and  achieving such a designation does not automatically =
qualify students for the program.
 Institutional Nominee
    State public colleges and universities may nominate students attendi=
ng their institutions for the Academic Scholars Program based on criteria e=
stablished by each individual institution. Nominees will be selected throug=
