The following are financial aid programs available to students who are residents of the state of Kentucky.

### Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship

The 1998 General Assembly provided Kentucky high school students and GED recipients a great opportunity to make their education pay with the Kentucky    Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES)! KEES, administered by the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (KHEAA), is funded by Kentucky Lottery    proceeds. Students who try to get the most from high school by studying hard and making good grades (2.5 GPA or higher) can earn scholarships for college    or technical school. The better students do in high school, the more they will earn toward college scholarships. And students who complete their college    studies have a better opportunity to achieve their career goals and improve their standard of living. GED recipients may earn awards based on their ACT    scores.

Eligibility Requirements

To be eligible for a KEES yearly GPA award, a high school student must:

- Be a U.S. citizen, national or permanent resident.

        Have earned at least a 2.5 GPA in any year of high school while meeting the KEES curriculum requirements.

         You do not have to apply for a KEES award. It is sent automatically to the college you're attending after the school lets KHEAA know that you are        attending classes.    
    Going to college out of state? The ONLY way to use KEES out-of-state is through a program called the Academic Common Market (ACM). Students must be    enrolled at a public university in a state that participates in the ACM and be pursuing an approved ACM program of study to use their KEES outside    Kentucky. For more information about the ACM and the current list of programs and schools eligible for the program, visit the Council on Postsecondary    Education website.
    Please note: Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois are not in the ACM. KEES cannot be used at a college in one of those states.

College Access Program (CAP)

  
    The College Access Program (CAP) helps Kentucky's financially needy undergraduate students attend eligible public and private colleges and universities,    proprietary schools, and technical colleges. CAP Grants may be awarded to Kentucky residents enrolled for at least six semester hours (half time) in    academic programs that take at least two years to complete. To be considered for a CAP Grant, the total expected family contribution (EFC) toward the    student's educational expenses cannot exceed $5,273.
    Eligible part-time college students will receive an amount calculated on $79 per credit hour. Part-time amounts for CAP recipients attending quarter-hour    institutions are calculated according to a schedule provided to the institutions. This grant has an aggregate limit of 250% of an annual award for an    associate's degree and 450% of an annual award for a bachelor's degree. This means that full-time students at a semester school will use all their    eligibility for an associate's degree in 2 1/2 years.
    To apply, students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You can obtain up to three paper copies of the FAFSA by calling the    Federal Student Aid Information Center toll free at 800.433.3243 or you can apply online. CAP Grants are awarded to    eligible applicants on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are exhausted.

Kentucky Tuition Grant (KTG)

    The Kentucky Tuition Grant (KTG) Program provides need-based grants to qualified Kentucky residents to attend the Commonwealth's independent colleges.    Eligible institutions must be accredited by a regional accrediting association recognized by U.S. Department of Education and not be comprised solely of    religious instruction.
    The program is designed to assist students with the higher tuition charges at the independent colleges. Students must be full-time undergraduates enrolled    in an associate or baccalaureate degree program and have no past due financial obligations to KHEAA or to any Title IV program. Credit hours attempted by    correspondence or internet courses are not acceptable for grant enrollment purposes, except for courses taken through the Kentucky Virtual    Campus. This grant has an aggregate limit of 250% of an annual award for an associate's degree and 450% of an annual award for a bachelor's degree. This    means that full-time students at a semester school will use all their eligibility for an associate's degree in 2 1/2 years.

Go Higher Grant

  
 Better Education, Better Life
    The new Go Higher Grant can get you on your way.
    Are you stuck in a job you don't enjoy? Do you want better pay, but don't qualify for a promotion? The answer is college. A college education can lead you    to the job of your dreams with the pay you desire.
    A new, need-based grant program is available for adults like you. The Go Higher Grant gives adults age 24 or older with no previous college experience up    to ,000 for one academic year when they enroll in a participating Kentucky college or university less than half-time, which is usually one or two    courses. The award covers tuition and a book allowance of $50 per credit hour.
    To be eligible you must:

        Be a Kentucky resident    
        Be a U.S. citizen, national or permanent resident    
        Be age 24 or older    
        Never have taken college classes    
        Demonstrate financial need    

    To apply for the Go Higher Grant, you must complete a Go Higher Grant application and a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Both applications    are also available at local adult education centers. There is no deadline. Students are encouraged to apply as soon as possible because funds are limited.

Teacher Scholarship

    The KHEAA Teacher Scholarship Program provides financial aid to highly qualified Kentucky students pursuing initial teacher certification at participating    Kentucky institutions. All applicants must be Kentucky residents enrolled full-time (unless enrolled for the final term of a teacher certification program    and less than full-time enrollment is required to complete the program). Applicants must demonstrate financial need and meet their institution's education    program GPA requirements to qualify for a KHEAA Teacher Scholarship.
    As funding allows, juniors, seniors, postbaccalaureate, or graduate students may receive $2,500 for each semester; and $1,250 for summer. Freshmen and    sophomores may receive $625 each semester; and $325 for summer.&lt;/p&gt;
    If a recipient does not complete their institution's education program or does not render qualified teaching service at a school certified by the Kentucky    Department of Education, the scholarship becomes a loan and the recipient is required to repay the amount disbursed with 6% interest from the date of    disbursement.
    Make sure KHEAA receives your Teacher Scholarship application and the results of your FAFSA need analysis from the Central    Processor by May 1. Your college must verify you are in a major that will lead to initial teacher certification or your application will not be considered.    KHEAA will notify applicants regarding eligibility in early July. Results will also be available on Zip Access at that time.
    The KHEAA Help Desk can be reached at 800-818-2678 for problems logging into Zip Access.
  

Early Childhood Development Scholarship

    The Early Childhood Development Scholarship provides a seamless system to upgrade the professional development of child-care workers and trainers. The    state legislature and the Governor created the Early Childhood Development Scholarship as part of the KIDS NOW early childhood initiative. The scholarship    provides financial assistance, to the extent of available funds, in the form of nonrepayable tuition scholarships for Kentucky students who are pursuing    one of the following:

        Child Development Associate Credential

Mary Jo Young Scholarship

  
    The Mary Jo Young Scholarship is named for former KHEAA Board of Directors member, Mary Jo Young, in recognition of her outstanding history of public    service in her local community and for the Commonwealth of Kentucky to improve educational opportunities for Kentuckians. It is for high school students in    grades 9 thru 12 enrolled in dual credit classes at any college or university or students taking Advanced Placement courses through the Kentucky Virtual    High School. Students can receive tuition and expense reimbursement for up to two courses each semester. Awards are given with priority to low-income    students, minority or underrepresented students, and students in low-performing schools. Students apply to, and are selected by, the Kentucky Department of    Education.

Osteopathic Medicine Scholarship

    The Osteopathic Medicine Scholarship provides financial assistance to Kentucky students who attend Pikeville College's School of Osteopathic Medicine. The    award is equal to the difference between the average amount charged for in-state tuition at the state medical schools and tuition at the Pikeville College    School of Osteopathic Medicine. Recipients must practice 2000 hours in Kentucky for each year they receive a scholarship. Recipients who do not complete    the program or do not practice in a qualified field of service in Kentucky must repay the scholarship with 6% interest.

        Family Practice    
        General Practice

Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust

    The Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust can help families save, in a planned way, for a child's higher education. A Trust account can be opened for a    beneficiary of any age; and the method, schedule, and amount of contributions are determined by the account owner. Earnings are exempt from Kentucky taxes    and any withdrawal used for qualified college expenses will be free of federal income taxes. Deposits can be as little as $25 (or $15 if made through    payroll deduction), and the Trust offers competitive savings rates. The younger the child is when participation begins, the better prepared the family will    be to meet growing educational costs.
    To request more information, call toll free 1-877-KY TRUST (1-877-598-7878), or visit www.kysaves.com.

Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition

    Kentucky's Affordable Prepaid Tuition (KAPT) provides another approach for families who want to plan now for their children's future college expenses at a    public, private, or out-of-state institution. Depending on which KAPT plan is purchased, the program guarantees to pay tuition at Kentucky's public    colleges or universities or average tuition at Kentucky's private colleges and universities in exchange for early tuition purchased by lump sum or in    monthly payments. Like KESPT, funds can be used at any accredited postsecondary school in the country, and withdrawals used for qualified higher education    expenses are free from federal and state income taxes. Because no two families are exactly alike when it comes to their college savings needs, KHEAA    recommends that parents carefully evaluate the advantages and differences between KESPT and KAPT. KAPT is currently closed to new enrollments.
    For more information, visit www.getKAPT.com or call toll free (888) 919-KAPT.
