Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust

    The Kentucky Education Savings Plan Trust can help families save, in=
 a planned way, for a child=E2=80=99s higher education. A Trust account can=
 be opened for a    beneficiary of any age; and the method, schedule, and a=
mount of contributions are determined by the account owner. Earnings are ex=
empt from Kentucky taxes    and any withdrawal used for qualified college e=
xpenses will be free of federal income taxes. Deposits can be as little as =
$25 (or $15 if made through    payroll deduction), and the Trust offers com=
petitive savings rates. The younger the child is when participation begins,=
 the better prepared the family will    be to meet growing educational cost=
s.

8-7878), or visit www.kysaves.com.

Kentucky=E2=80=99s Affordable Prepaid Tuition

    Kentucky=E2=80=99s Affordable Prepaid Tuition (KAPT) provides anothe=
r approach for families who want to plan now for their children=E2=80=99s f=
uture college expenses at a    public, private, or out-of-state institution=
. Depending on which KAPT plan is purchased, the program guarantees to pay =
tuition at Kentucky=E2=80=99s public    colleges or universities or average=
 tuition at Kentucky=E2=80=99s private colleges and universities in exchang=
e for early tuition purchased by lump sum or in    monthly payments. Like K=
ESPT, funds can be used at any accredited postsecondary school in the count=
ry, and withdrawals used for qualified higher education    expenses are fre=
e from federal and state income taxes. Because no two families are exactly =
alike when it comes to their college savings needs, KHEAA    recommends tha=
t parents carefully evaluate the advantages and differences between KESPT a=
nd KAPT. KAPT is currently closed to new enrollments.
