ograms listed.
    The following are financial aid programs available to students who a=
re residents of the state of Massachusetts.

Foster Child Grant Program

    The Foster Child Grant Program was funded by the Massachuse=
tts Legislature in 2001. The program provides grants of up to 00 annually f=
or fosterchildren to help pay for an education beyond high school at any in=
stitution of higher learning throughout the continental United States. The =
   Foster Child Grant recipient must have signed an agreement with=
 the Department of Social Services for care and services beyond age 18.

MASSGrant Program

  
    The MASSGrant is a grant assistance program funded by appro=
priations from the Massachusetts Legislature. The MASSGrant progra=
m provides    need-based financial assistance to undergraduate students who=
 reside in Massachusetts and who are enrolled in and pursuing a program of =
higher education in    any approved public or independent college, universi=
ty, school of nursing or any other approved institution furnishing a progra=
m of higher education.

Gilbert Matching Student Grant Program

    The Massachusetts Gilbert Matching Student Grant Program (G=
MSGP) makes funds available to participating Massachusetts=E2=80=99 institu=
tions of higher education and schools of nursing. At least one hundred perc=
ent of such funds must be    used for direct financial assistance to needy =
Massachusetts=E2=80=99s undergraduate students to enable them to attend or =
continue to attend such institutions.

Cash Grant Program

    The Cash Grant Program is designed to assist needy students=
 in meeting institutionally held charges such as mandatory fees and non-sta=
te-supported    tuition. It is a complementary program to the Need-Base=
d Tuition Waiver Program. The Cash Grant is designed as an of=
fset of the Tuition    Waiver Program for the purpose of providing financia=
l support to those individuals who would be denied the opportunity for high=
er education, without such    assistance. Since its inception, the Cash Gra=
nt has been utilized as supplemental grants in campus-based financial aid p=
ackaging strategies, representing    an important mechanism for public inst=
itutions to assist needy students.

Part-Time Grant Program

  
    Demographic changes impacting current and future student population =
have a direct relationship to the number of part-time students who seek hig=
her    education. In Massachusetts, as in some other states, the number of =
part-time students has grown due to shifts in the states=E2=80=99 demograph=
ic and economic    conditions. More adults now find themselves needing to r=
eturn to the classroom on a less than full-time basis. The continuous incre=
ase in college costs is    also requiring more students to reconsider their=
 enrollment plans and to look at part-time programs as viable alternatives.=
 The Commonwealth has recognized    the above needs and established the Part-Time Grant Program to serve as a bridge between higher education=
 opportunities and those segments of the    Massachusetts population.

Public Service Grant Program

  
    The Massachusetts Public Service Grant Program was establis=
hed in recognition of the hardship that a family experiences upon the loss =
of a parent    and or spouse who is killed or missing in the line of public=
 service duty in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This grant program was =
established to    provide educational opportunity to the remaining family m=
embers. The Public Service Grant Program is the only scholarship program no=
t based on demonstrated    financial need, but rather entitlement.

Paraprofessional Teacher Preparation Grant Program

    The Paraprofessional Teacher Preparation Grant Program was =
established by the Legislature for the purpose of providing financial assis=
tance to    Massachusetts residents who are currently employed as paraprofe=
ssionals in Massachusetts public schools, but wish to become certified as f=
ull time    teachers. This grant is designed to help reduce financial barri=
ers that often become obstacles for many paraprofessionals in attaining hig=
her education.    The program is also an attempt to help address the Common=
wealth=E2=80=99s current teacher shortage. Financial need is not a requirem=
ent for the Paraprofessional    Teacher Preparation Grant. However, recipie=
nts must annually file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)=
.

Massachusetts Educational Rewards Grant Program

    The Educational Rewards Grant Program was established by th=
e Legislature for the purpose of providing financial assistance to dislocat=
ed or    incumbent workers to enable them to receive the education they nee=
d to transition into jobs in targeted high-demand occupations. The grant pr=
ogram emanates    from the economic stimulus bill that is contained in Chap=
ter 123 of the Acts of 2006 (Ch. 29 Sect. 2SSS of the M.G.L.). Such a bill =
is relative to the    economic investments in the Commonwealth to promote j=
ob creation, economic growth, competitiveness and overall stability in the =
Massachusetts economy. This    need-based grant program is to sreve as a la=
st resort after all other federal and state financial aid resources have be=
en exhausted in meeting    postsecondary education enrollment costs. The Ed=
ucational Rewards Grant Program also allows up to 30 percent of the award a=
mount to be used by the student    toward living expenses.

Agnes M. Lindsay Scholarship Program

    The Agnes M. Lindsay Scholarship provides scholarships for =
students with demonstrated financial need who are from rural areas of Massa=
chusetts and    attend public institutions of higher education within the C=
ommonwealth of Massachusetts.

Christian A. Herter Scholarship Program

    The Christian A. Herter Memorial Scholarship Program is a s=
tate-supported program whose mission includes providing educational opportu=
nities toCommonwealth students who demonstrate academic promise and desire =
to attend post-secondary institutions. The    Christian A. Herter Memor=
ial Scholarship Program was established in 1972 by the Massachusetts S=
tate Legislature as an early identification program    to recruit students =
in the 10th and 11th grades whose socio-economic backgrounds and environmen=
tal conditions may inhibit their ability to persevere and    attain educati=
onal goals.
    To accomplish its mission, the Christian A. Herter Memorial Scho=
larship Program has developed an extensive partnership of representati=
ves from    social service agencies, public and private secondary instituti=
ons, civic agencies, religious organizations, and the educational community=
. Students are    nominated by guidance counselors, social workers, ministe=
rs and educators who are familiar with their circumstances and selected sem=
i-finalists participate    in a rigorous interview process. Each year, 25 s=
tudents in the 10th and 11th grades are selected to receive awards of up to=
 50 percent (50%) of their    calculated need at the college of their choic=
e within the continental United States. The students that are selected for =
this program must have overcome    major adversity in their lives (i.e. phy=
sical or mental abuse, catastrophic illness, etc.). Obstacles may be mental=
, physical, geographic or societal.    Students must exhibit academic poten=
tial for post-secondary success. There are approximately 100 students that =
are currently enrolled in colleges and    universities across the United St=
ates with the assistance of the Christian A. Herter Memorial Scholarshi=
p.

John and Abigail Adams Scholarship Program

The John and Abigail Adams Scholarship awards non-need-based st=
ate-supported undergraduate tuition waivers to students who are awarded    =
John and Abigail Adams Scholarship by the Department of Education.=
 The purposes of the Adams Scholarship are to:

        Reward and inspire student achievement;    
        Help attract more high-performing students to Massachusetts pub=
lic higher education; and    
        Provide families of college-bound students with financial assis=
tance.    


Paul Tsongas Scholarship Program

    The Paul Tsongas Scholarship Program seeks to recognize ach=
ievement and reward Massachusetts students who have graduated from high sch=
ool within    three years with a grade point average (G.P.A.) of 3.75 and a=
 Scholastic Aptitude Test (S.A.T.) score of at least 1200 (or the American =
College Testing    [A.C.T.] equivalent) and who also meet the one year resi=
dency requirement for tuition classification at the State Colleges. Student=
s who meet the above    residency requirement for tuition classification an=
d who have pursued other endeavors for a minimum of five years are eligible=
 to apply to a State College    for the Paul Tsongas Scholarship Program un=
der the exceptional life experience category set forth in the Guidelines. E=
ligible students receive a waiver of    tuition and mandatory fees at a Mas=
sachusetts State College.

Early Childhood Educators Scholarship Program

    The Early Childhood Educators Scholarship Program was funde=
d as a pilot initiative by the Legislature for the purpose of increasing th=
e quality    and availability of teachers and care providers to work with y=
oung children in inclusive settings including infant/toddler, preschool and=
 child care    programs. The scholarship is designed to provide financial a=
ssistance for currently employed early childhood educators and providers wh=
o enroll in an    associate or bachelor degree program in Early Childhood E=
ducation or related programs.

Math and Science Teachers Scholarship Program

    The Mathematics and Science (including Technology/Engineering) T=
eachers Scholarship Program was established as a pilot initiative by t=
he    Massachusetts Legislature for the purpose of providing financial assi=
stance to teachers who are currently employed in Massachusetts public schoo=
ls, but who    have received waivers from certification regulations or are =
teaching outside their certificate area (out of field teachers). This schol=
arship serves to    address the mathematics and science teacher shortage an=
d is also designed to help reduce financial barriers that teachers often fa=
ce when pursuing degree    programs or required courses of study.

Career Advancement Program Tuition Waiver

  
    The Career Advancement Program Tuition Waiver is designed t=
o reward Massachusetts=E2=80=99s public school teachers in their first thre=
e years of teaching    who have passed all three components of the Massachu=
setts Teachers Test. It is further believed that the Career Advancement=
 Program Tuition Waiver    helps to increase the retention of new teac=
hers during the first three years when attrition is highest; by rewarding t=
eachers with career advancement    opportunities. Eligible public school te=
achers receive up to three tuition-free state-supported graduate courses, o=
ne for each of their first three years    of teaching. The value of the tui=
tion waivers is approximately $300 per course.
  

Categorical Tuition Waiver

  
    The Categorical Tuition Waivers are a component of the =
Single Tuition Waiver Program and have the same purpose of maintaining=
 access to    the Commonwealth=E2=80=99s public colleges and universities. =
The Categorical Tuition Waivers are designed to provide financial =
support to individuals who    might not have the opportunity to achieve hig=
her education, without such assistance.

Collaborative Teachers Tuition Waiver

    The Collaborative Teachers Tuition Waiver encourages Massac=
husetts=E2=80=99s public school teachers to become mentors to full-time stu=
dent teachers from    State colleges and universities. The program is desig=
ned to support the professional development of public school teachers in th=
e Commonwealth. Under the    agreement, the mentoring teacher receives a wa=
iver for up to one graduate-level course for each student teacher he/she me=
ntors. The waiver can be used for    courses in education or related to the=
 teacher=E2=80=99s major field offered by State colleges and the University=
 of Massachusetts.
  

Hurricane Katrina Emergency Tuition Waiver

In response to the results of Hurricane Katrina, the Massachusetts Board=
 of Higher Education created the    Commonwealth Hurricane Katrina Emer=
gency Tuition Waiver to provide free tuition to undergraduate students=
 displaced from attending colleges and    universities due to Hurricane Kat=
rina and who are attending public colleges and universities in Massachusett=
s.
  

DSS Tuition Waiver For Foster Care Children

  
    The Department of Social Services Tuition Waiver for Foster Care=
 Children is designed to provide financial support for higher educatio=
n to foster    children in state custody who were neither adopted nor retur=
ned home. It is believed that these children have few support systems and s=
ignificant needs.    Without the benefit of parental support, foster childr=
en, whose lives are filled with numerous obstacles, face the additional cha=
llenge of financing their    education when they enroll as students in high=
er education institutions. While foster care children qualify for financial=
 aid, many face the burden of    acquiring student loans to meet their educ=
ational costs. The DSS Tuition Waiver for Foster Care Children pro=
vides a valuable resource for them and    will help reduce their educationa=
l loan debt.
  

DSS Adopted Children Tuition Waiver

    The DSS Adopted Children Tuition Waiver is designed to less=
en the financial burden on adopting parents in the Commonwealth. This Waive=
r extends    eligibility to all children and young adults, age twenty-four =
or under, adopted through the Department of Social Services by state employ=
ees or eligible    Massachusetts residents, regardless of the date of adopt=
ion. The tuition waiver encompasses 100% of tuition for state-supported cou=
rses at all of the    Massachusetts public institutions of higher education=
, excluding graduate courses and courses in the MD program at the Universit=
y of Massachusetts Medical    Center.
  

Graduate Tuition Waiver

    The Graduate Tuition Waiver is another component of the Single Tuition Waiver program that provides incentives to individuals=
 to enroll    in graduate programs at Massachusetts public colleges and uni=
versities. It is the underlying principle of the Graduate Tuition Waive=
r policy that,    by providing these incentives, the public higher edu=
cation system will continue to improve student quality and maintain the col=
laboration that is necessary    to the efficiency and effectiveness of the =
system.
  
  

High Technology Scholar/Intern Tuition Waiver

    The High Technology Scholar/Intern Tuition Waiver Program p=
rovides an incentive to business and industry to support the computer infor=
mation    technology/science and engineering students through scholarships =
and internships. Public higher education institutions are encouraged to see=
k funding from    business and industry for computer and information scienc=
e and technology and engineering scholarships that the Commonwealth will, i=
n turn, match with a    full waiver of the cost of a student=E2=80=99s annu=
al tuition charges. In addition to scholarships and tuition waivers, studen=
ts participating in the program gain    real life experience in their chose=
n paths through business and industry internships. This program provides ad=
ded incentive for high-achieving high school    students to attend public i=
nstitutions of higher education in Massachusetts.
  

Incentive Program For Aspiring Teachers Program

    The Incentive Program for Aspiring Teachers Tuition Waiver =
is designed to complement the Tomorrow=E2=80=99s Teachers Scholarship P=
rogram whichseeks to attract qualified high school students to the tea=
ching profession by providing four-year tuition and fees scholarships. The =
   Incentive Program for Aspiring Teachers provides support to qua=
lified students who after enrolling in college and earning a minimum 3.0 gr=
ade    point average, decide to enter a certification program in a field wi=
th demonstrated teacher shortages. Students who participate in the program =
must commit    to teaching for two years in a public school in the Commonwe=
alth, upon successful completion of a bachelor=E2=80=99s degree from the co=
llege or university.    Students who participate in the program but do not =
complete their college education within four years of entering the certific=
ation program or who fail to    complete their two-year teaching commitment=
 within four years following graduation from college, shall be obligated to=
 pay the Commonwealth the full amount    of the tuition waivers granted thr=
ough the Incentive Program for Aspiring Teachers.
  

MEFA-Prepaid Tuition Waiver Program

    The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority-Prepaid Tuitio=
n Waiver Program allows a participating public institution of higher e=
ducation to    waive the amount of tuition that would otherwise be due from=
 the eligible student if the tuition charged by the participating public in=
stitution exceeds    the amount received as a tuition credit pursuant to th=
e MEFA Prepaid Tuition Program for the year the tuition credit is =
redeemed, in direct    proportion to the eligible student=E2=80=99s partici=
pation in the Prepaid Tuition Program.
  

Need Based Tuition Waiver Program

    Created in 1981, the Massachusetts Tuition Waiver Program e=
xists to offset increases in tuition and maintain access to the Commonwealt=
h=E2=80=99s public    colleges and universities. An underlying goal of the =
Tuition Waiver Policy is that future public sector tuition increas=
es be matched with a    concomitant increase in the maximum award for the f=
inancially neediest students. Another principle of the Tuition Waiver P=
rogram is the belief    that the benefits of higher education must be =
available to all citizens. Over the years, tuition waivers have been utiliz=
ed as supplemental scholarships in    campus-based financial aid packaging =
strategies.
  
Stanley Z. Koplik Certificate of Mastery Tuition Waiver Program&lt;=
/h3&gt;

    The Stanley Z. Koplik Certificate of Mastery Tuition Waiver=
 awards non-need-based state-supported undergraduate tuition waivers to stu=
dents who    are awarded the Stanley Z. Koplik Certificate of =
Mastery by the Department of Education. The purposes of the Certificat=
e of Mastery are    to:

        Recognize high academic achievement on MCAS and other measures =
of academic achievement;    
        Recognize high academic achievement as identified by outside fo=
rums including competitions, student publications, and awards;    
        Provide an incentive for students to perform to their best abil=
ities on MCAS and on the course of studies beyond grade 10; and    
        Recognize high academic achievement in areas not included in MC=
AS.    

  

September 11, 2001, Tragedy Tuition Waiver Program

    The Commonwealth September 11, 2001, Tragedy Tuition Waiver=
 recognizes the challenge that children or spouses of victims of the nation=
al tragedy    may face in their attempt to pay for a college education. The=
 Massachusetts Board of Higher Education has expanded the Tuition Waive=
r Program toinclude residents of the Commonwealth who are directly aff=
ected by the September 11 events. The    Commonwealth September 11, 200=
1 Tragedy Tuition Waiver provides a 100 percent tuition waiver to chil=
dren and widowed spouses of Massachusetts    residents for any state suppor=
ted course or program offered by a Massachusetts public college or universi=
ty.
  

UMASS Exchange Tuition Waiver Program

    The University of Massachusetts Exchange Tuition Waiver Program&lt;=
/em&gt; encourages direct reciprocal and regional cross-registration agreement=
s where the    University enters into cooperative learning contracts with o=
ther institutions allowing students to receive comparable waivers for cross=
-institution    registration. Under such an agreement, University of Massac=
husetts students attend exchange institutions without tuition charge and ex=
change students    attend the University without tuition charge, or with pa=
yment at in-state rates to the home institution. These exchange programs ar=
e limited and involve    only institutions with which the University has si=
gned a cooperative learning contract and where the University feels the exp=
erience of the exchange    program significantly enhances the learning expe=
rience of the students who participate.

ract and enroll Massachusetts=E2=80=99s high school students who have been =
designated as    valedictorians. The program allows a high school valedicto=
rian to become eligible to receive a waiver of tuition at any public higher=
 education institutionin Massachusetts. Since it opened, the program has pr=
edominantly supported the University of Massachusetts Universi=
ty Scholars Program .
  

Washington Center Program Tuition Waiver Program

    The Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminar =
provides experiential education opportunities to students of the Massachuse=
tts public    college and university system. The Center uses the resources =
of the nation=E2=80=99s capital to provide high-quality learning experience=
s to enhance student=E2=80=99s    academic, civic, and professional develop=
ment, and in this way, seeks to promote future leadership for the public, p=
rivate, and non-profit sectors of    society. The Washington Center=E2=80=
