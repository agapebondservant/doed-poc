Work Study

    Work-study programs are a form of financial aid in which you perform=
 work in exchange for money for your education. Federal government programs=
 are the    primary source of work-study, but individual college campuses m=
ay also offer their own programs to make additional financial aid available=
 to as many    students as possible.
    Work-study programs have rules about whether the work can be on-camp=
us or off-campus and about the maximum number of hours per week you can wor=
k. Your    campus financial aid office should have the details specific to =
your program.
    In order to apply for Federal Work Study, submit the FAFSA and indic=
ate an interest in work-study in section 1 of the FAFSA.
    To find out if there are campus-specific work-study programs at the =
school you plan to attend, contact that school=E2=80=99s financial aid offi=
