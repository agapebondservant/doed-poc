GI BILL

  
    Legislation that provides money for veterans to pay for tuition and fees for public, in-state schools, along with other school-related costs.    
    Recipients can receive paid tuition and fees for public in-state schools, a living stipend and an allowance for books and supplies (around $1,000 per    year.)    
    Education benefits are also available for disabled veterans, and survivors and dependents of veterans.    
    The Post-9/11 GI Bill became effective on Aug. 1, 2009, and veterans who have served after Sept. 10, 2001, with at least 90 days of continuous service, are    eligible. The bill also gives Reserve and Guard members who have been activated for more than 90 days since 9/11 access to the same benefits as active-duty    soldiers.    
    You may also be eligible for a fee waiver at a public college if you have financial need and are the child or dependent of a service-connected disabled or    deceased veteran, or the recipient or the child of a recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor.    
    For more information, contact your college's veteran affairs office or the local office of the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs at (888) 442-4551, or go    to gibill.va.gov.
LOANS
    (money you have to repay later)    
 Federal Perkins Loans    are made through participating schools to undergraduate, graduate and professional degree students, both full-time and part-time, who demonstrate financial    need. These particular loans are repaid to your school.    
 Stafford Loans    are for undergraduate, graduate and professional degree students. You must be enrolled as at least a half-time student to be eligible for a Stafford Loan.    Stafford Loans are either subsidized and unsubsidized, meaning the government either pays the interest during school or it doesn't. Financial need is not a    requirement to obtain an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, but you are responsible for paying the interest that accrues on unsubsidized Stafford Loans.    
 PLUS Loans    (Direct or FFEL) are loans parents can obtain to help pay the cost of education for their dependent undergraduate children. In addition, graduate and    professional degree students may obtain PLUS Loans to help pay for their own education.    
 Consolidation Loans    (Direct or FFEL) allow student or parent borrowers to combine multiple federal education loans into one loan with one monthly payment.

WORK-STUDY

  
    Every year, millions of students take advantage of the Federal Work-Study (FWS) program, holding down jobs both on-campus and off-campus. If you're    eligible for work-study, a school will figure it in on your financial aid award letter. Work-study is a great way to help pay for tuition, books, and room    and board =E2=80=94 and the possibilities are endless. You could take a service-related job at a local community center, or work in an academic department at your    school. If you're a night owl, you could work a late shift in the library. If you're an early riser, you could help serve breakfast in the student commons.    And while the total amount you make can't exceed your work-study award for the year, it's smart to make the most you can. Work-study can also be a good    distraction during a tough day of classes and studying. If work-study is part of your award, it means the money has already been set aside for you, so    don't miss out. Get to work!
    The Federal Work-Study (FWS) program gives part-time jobs to undergraduate and graduate students with financial need. You can work to make money to pay for    education expenses, including tuition, books, and room and board. If you are eligible, your college or university will include work-study in your financial    aid award letter.
    The FWS program encourages community service, as well as work related to what you're studying in school. You'll make at least the current federal minimum    wage. Some earn more, but it depends on what you're doing and what skills are required.
    Your total award will depend on when you apply, your level of financial need and the funding level of your school. If you're an undergraduate, you'll be    paid by the hour. If you're a graduate student, you might receive a salary. Either way, your school must pay you at least once a month. Also, your school    must pay you directly.
    FWS jobs can be on or off campus. If you work on campus, you'll usually work for your school. If you work off campus, you will usually work for a private    non-profit organization or a public agency. Generally, the work performed off campus must be in the public interest, which means it must benefit some    portion of the general public.
    You can't earn more than your total award. Also, when scheduling your work, your employer or financial aid administrator will look at your class schedule    and your academic progress to make sure you're keeping up in school and maintaining a good balance between work and study.

HOPE SCHOLARSHIP CREDIT (HSC)

    The HSC tax credit is worth up to $1,500 per year for each student. There is a 100% tax credit for the first $1,000 paid for qualified expenses, and a 50%    tax credit for the second $1,000.
