      Changes From the FUTURE Act The Fostering
      Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for
      Education (FUTURE) Act authorized a direct
      data exchange 3 the FUTURE Act Direct Data
      Exchange (FA-DDX) 3 with the Internal
      Revenue Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA
      form. The previous tool to transfer U.S.
      income and tax information from the IRS 3
      the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) 3 was
      retired after the close of the 2023-24 application
      cycle. Implementation of the FA-DDX eliminated the
      need for most applicants (and their spouse or
      parents) to self-report their income and tax
      information reported to the IRS. Also, federal tax
      information (FTI) that is transferred via the
      FA-DDX to the FAFSA form is considered verified
      for Title IV purposes. Unlike with the IRS-DRT,
      which allowed applicants to opt in, the FA-DDX
      requires applicants and contributors (student9s spouse
      and/or parents, as appropriate) to provide
      consent and approval for the Department to
      obtain FTI from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use
      it to determine the student9s eligibility
      for federal student aid.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) and what
          does it do?
        answer: The FA-DDX is a direct data exchange authorized by the FUTURE
          Act between the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue
          Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. It eliminates
          the need for most applicants to self-report income and tax
          information, as federal tax information is transferred directly and
          considered verified for Title IV purposes.
      - question: How does the FA-DDX differ from the IRS Data Retrieval Tool
          (DRT) in terms of consent?
        answer: Unlike the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt-in, the
          FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student's spouse and/or
          parents) to provide explicit consent and approval for the Department
          to obtain federal tax information from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use
          it to determine the student's eligibility for federal student aid.
      - question: When was the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) retired and what
          replaced it?
        answer: The IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) was retired after the close of
          the 2023-24 application cycle. It was replaced by the FUTURE Act
          Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX), which provides a direct data exchange
          between the Department of Education and the IRS to facilitate FAFSA
          completion.

        answer: The Parent Tax Filing Status section has been expanded to
          explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when each should
          be selected, as well as addressing conflicting information that
          requires resolution (comment code 303).

      Chapter 4: Verification, Updates, and Corrections -
      We added a note regarding the unavailability
      of the Verification of Identity functionality
      in the FPP and the flexibility the Department
      provided around reporting timeframes. - We added a
      note to the <Using the Tax Return=
      section regarding the treatment negative values
      when calculating Income Earned from Work. - We renamed
      the <Special Cases= section to <Unique
      Situations and Exceptions= and moved
      <Verification for Confined or Incarcerated
      Individuals= to a subsection under this
      renamed section. - Under <Filers of Amended Returns=,
      we removed the exception to not update tax
      information for certain amended tax return filers. This
      exception was outlined in Electronic
      Announcement GEN-24-29 and was limited to the
      2024-25 application cycle. - We updated acceptable
      documentation guidance for individuals who are
      victims of tax-related identity theft. - We added
      subsection <Birth of a Child= under the
      <Updating Information= section.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What changes were made to the Verification of Identity
          functionality in the FPP?
        answer: A note was added regarding the unavailability of the
          Verification of Identity functionality in the FPP and the flexibility
          the Department provided around reporting timeframes.
      - question: How were negative values treated in calculating Income Earned
          from Work?
        answer: A note was added to the Using the Tax Return section regarding
          the treatment of negative values when calculating Income Earned from
          Work.
      - question: What modifications were done to the Special Cases section and
          the exception for certain amended tax return filers?
        answer: The Special Cases section was renamed to Unique Situations and
          Exceptions, and Verification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals
          was moved to a subsection under this. The exception to not update tax
          information for certain amended tax return filers was removed, as it
          was limited to the 2024-25 application cycle.

      The Application Process: FAFSA to ISIR The
      laws governing the Federal Student Aid (FSA)
      programs require that a person apply for aid
      with a form provided by the U.S. Department
      of Education (ED, Department) and that no
      fee be charged for processing it. This form
      is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
      (FAFSA ® ) form. To be considered for federal
      student aid, a student must complete a FAFSA
      form. It collects financial and other
      information used to calculate the Student Aid
      Index (SAI; formerly Expected Family Contribution
      or EFC) and to determine a student9s
      eligibility through computer matches with other
      agencies. The FAFSA form is the only application
      students must complete to apply for Title
      IV aid. A school cannot require extra information
      from students to package Title IV aid, except
      for verification, resolution of conflicting
      information, or professional judgment determinations.
      However, a school may require additional
      information for other purposes, such as packaging
      private or institutional aid. If the school
      collects additional information that affects Title
      IV eligibility, it must take the information
      into account when awarding Title IV aid.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the form required by law for applying for Federal
          Student Aid (FSA) programs, and who provides it?
        answer: The form is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA
          ® ), provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED, Department).
      - question: What information does the FAFSA form collect, and how is it
          used?
        answer: The FAFSA form collects financial and other information to
          calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI) and determine a student's
          eligibility for federal student aid.
      - question: Can a school require additional information beyond the FAFSA
          for Title IV aid packaging, and if so, under what circumstances?
        answer: A school may require additional information for other purposes,
          such as packaging private or institutional aid, but it cannot require
          extra information for Title IV aid packaging except for verification,
          resolving conflicting information, or professional judgment
          determinations.

      FAFSA Online Implementation of the FAFSA Simplification
      Act and the FUTURE Act required a
      complete overhaul of the FAFSA form,
      beginning with the 2024-25 award year. Submitted
      FAFSA forms are sent directly to the FAFSA
      Processing System (FPS). Help is available for
      students online or by calling the Federal
      Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-4-FED-
      AID (1-800-433-3243). There are many advantages to
      filing electronically, including: - Faster processing; -
      Availability of online help; - Skip logic, which allows
      applicants to skip over questions that don9t
      pertain to them; and - Fewer errors and rejected
      applications because internal and end-of-entry data
      edits ensure that required fields are completed and
      conflicts are resolved prior to submission.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: When does the overhauled FAFSA form with the FAFSA
          Simplification Act and FUTURE Act implementation begin?
        answer: The overhauled FAFSA form begins with the 2024-25 award year.
      - question: What are the benefits of filing the FAFSA electronically?
        answer: Electronic filing offers faster processing, online help
          availability, skip logic to bypass irrelevant questions, and reduced
          errors due to built-in data edits.
      - question: How can students get assistance with the FAFSA form?
        answer: Students can receive help online or by contacting the Federal

      to access and submit the online FAFSA form and
      complete other limited actions on StudentAid.gov.
      However, the Department will not be able

      and password is verified through a match with
      the SSA. If the SSN match is unsuccessful,
      the account is not considered verified, and
      an email is sent to notify the individual
      that they should review the information they
      provided (name, date of birth, and SSN) to
      ensure it is accurate. If the applicant used
      an unverified account username and password

          retrieved from the IRS.
      - question: What happens if the SSN match for account verification with
