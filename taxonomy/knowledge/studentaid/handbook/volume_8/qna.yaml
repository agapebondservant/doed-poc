      We have made the following changes in Volume 8
      for 2025-2026:
      - In Chapter 3, we have revised the discussion of
      loan periods to provide a limited exception to the
      longstanding requirement that the loan period for a
      Direct Loan may not include any terms in which the
      borrower is ineligible to receive Direct Loan
      funds.
      - Also in Chapter 3, we have added a slightly
      revised and expanded version of guidance on the
      treatment of Direct Loan disbursements made after the
      date of a borrower9s death that was previously
      in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook
      under the heading <Checking Eligibility at the
      Time of Disbursement.= Because this guidance is
      specific to Direct Loans, we believe Volume 8 is
      a more appropriate location.
      - In Chapter 5, we have revised Example 6 to
      reflect the limited exception to the requirement
      that a loan period may not include terms in which the
      borrower is ineligible (see Chapter 3 changes
      above).
      - In Chapter 7, we have revised the discussion of
      transfer students and abbreviated loan periods to
      clarify that in some circumstances a transfer
      student may be eligible to receive more Direct
      Loan funds for the program at the new school
      than a non-transfer student would be eligible to
      receive for that same program.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What changes have been made to Chapter 3 in Volume 8 for
          2025-2026 regarding Direct Loans?
        answer: In Chapter 3, a limited exception has been introduced to the
          rule that a Direct Loan's loan period cannot include ineligible terms
          for the borrower, and guidance on treating Direct Loan disbursements
          after a borrower's death has been added and moved from Volume 4,
          Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.
      - question: How has Chapter 5, Example 6 been revised in Volume 8 for
          2025-2026?
        answer: Example 6 in Chapter 5 has been revised to reflect the limited
          exception allowing a loan period to include ineligible terms for the
          borrower, as discussed in the changes to Chapter 3.
      - question: What modifications have been implemented in Chapter 7 of
          Volume 8 for 2025-2026 concerning transfer students and abbreviated
          loan periods?
        answer: Chapter 7 has been revised to clarify that transfer students
          may, in certain situations, be eligible for more Direct Loan funds for
          a program at their new school than a non-transfer student would be
          eligible for the same program.

      Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans
      Only students who have financial need may
      receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government
      does not charge interest on Direct Subsidized Loans
      while the borrower is enrolled on at
      least a half-time basis, during the grace and
      deferment periods, and during certain other periods (for
      example, during certain periods of repayment under
      certain repayment plans that determine the required
      monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and
      family size).
      If a student has received a determination of
      need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an
      amount of $200 or less, a school may choose not
      to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may
      instead include that amount as part of a Direct
      Unsubsidized Loan.
      Financial need is not an eligibility requirement
      to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal
      government generally charges interest on Direct
      Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited
      exceptions (for example, during periods of deferment for
      cancer treatment).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who is eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans?
        answer: Only students who have financial need may receive Direct
          Subsidized Loans.
      - question: What are the interest conditions for Direct Subsidized Loans?
        answer: The federal government does not charge interest on Direct
          Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time,
          during grace and deferment periods, and certain other periods.
      - question: Can a student with a Direct Subsidized Loan determination of
          $200 or less still receive a loan?
        answer: If a student has a Direct Subsidized Loan determination of $200
          or less, the school may choose not to originate the loan and instead
          include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan.

      Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans
      To be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized
      Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate
      student attending a school that participates in the
      Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a
      determination of their Pell Grant eligibility for the
      period of enrollment for which the student is
      requesting a loan.
      No Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan
      Students who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but
      they may not refuse to repay the loans based on
      a <defense of infancy= (that is, by claiming
      that they were too young to enter into the
      contract of signing the promissory note).
      No Defense of Infancy

      Requirement To Offer Both Subsidized and
      Unsubsidized Loans
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the eligibility criteria for Direct Subsidized and
          Direct Unsubsidized Loans?
        answer: An undergraduate student attending a school that participates in
          the Federal Pell Grant Program must first receive a determination of
          their Pell Grant eligibility for the period of enrollment for which
          the student is requesting a loan.
      - question: Can minors refuse to repay Direct Loans using the defense of
          infancy?
        answer: No, students who are minors may not refuse to repay Direct Loans
          based on a defense of infancy, even though they can receive these
          loans.
      - question: Is there a requirement for schools to offer both Direct
          Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans?
        answer: Yes, according to the Higher Education Act (HEA) Section
          484A(b)(2), schools are required to offer both Direct Subsidized and
          Direct Unsubsidized Loans.

      Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans
      If you verify that the parents of a dependent
      undergraduate student have refused to complete the
      parental information sections of the Free Application
      for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form or that they
      have ended financial support for the student, you may
      make a professional judgment decision to
      offer the student a Direct Unsubsidized Loan in an
      amount up to the applicable annual loan limit for a
      dependent undergraduate. For instance, under these
      circumstances a dependent second-year undergraduate could
      receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan
      funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume for information
      on annual loan limits). However, the student may
      not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any
      of the other Title IV programs.
      Self-certification from the dependent student is not
      sufficient to verify that the parents have ended
      financial support or have refused to complete the
      FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be
      met by obtaining a signed and dated statement
      from one of the student9s parents. For
      more information, see the discussion under
      <Dependent students without parent support= in the
      <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of
      the Application and Verification Guide.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Under what conditions can a dependent undergraduate student
          receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan?
        answer: A dependent undergraduate student can receive a Direct
          Unsubsidized Loan if their parents have refused to complete the
          parental information sections of the FAFSA form or ended financial
          support for the student.
      - question: What is the maximum Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount a
          dependent second-year undergraduate can receive without parental
          support?
        answer: A dependent second-year undergraduate can receive up to $6,500
          in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds without parental support.
      - question: How can a student verify that parents have ended financial
          support or refused FAFSA completion?
        answer: A student can verify this by obtaining a signed and dated
          statement from one of their parents, as self-certification is
          insufficient.

      Definition of <Parent= for Direct PLUS Loan
      Purposes
      If they meet all other Direct PLUS Loan eligibility
      requirements, the following individuals can borrow
      Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent
      undergraduate student:
      - The student9s biological parent;
      - The student9s legal adoptive parent; or
      - The student9s stepparent (spouse of the student9s
      biological or legal adoptive parent at the
      time of application), but only if the stepparent
      is required to provide their information on the
      FAFSA form in accordance with the instructions on the
      FAFSA form.
      Grandparents and other family members are not eligible
      to take out Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a
      dependent undergraduate student unless they have legally adopted the
      student.
      In addition to the parent(s) whose resources
      are reported on a student9s FAFSA form, any
      otherwise eligible biological or legal adoptive
      parent of the dependent undergraduate student can
      also take out a Direct PLUS Loan on the
      student9s behalf, even if that parent9s information
      is not reported on the FAFSA form.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent
          undergraduate student?
        answer: The student's biological parent, legal adoptive parent, or
          stepparent (spouse of the student's biological or legal adoptive
          parent at the time of application) can borrow Direct PLUS Loans,
          provided the stepparent is required to provide information on the
          FAFSA form.
      - question: Can grandparents or other family members borrow Direct PLUS
          Loans for a dependent undergraduate student?
        answer: No, grandparents and other family members cannot borrow Direct
          PLUS Loans for a dependent undergraduate student unless they have
          legally adopted the student.
      - question: Can a parent not reported on the FAFSA form still take out a
          Direct PLUS Loan for a dependent undergraduate student?
        answer: Yes, any otherwise eligible biological or legal adoptive parent
          of the dependent undergraduate student can take out a Direct PLUS
          Loan, even if their information is not reported on the FAFSA form.

      Requirement for Dependent Students To File a
      FAFSA Form
      In all cases, the dependent student on whose
      behalf a parent has applied for a Direct PLUS
      Loan must have filed a FAFSA form and received
      an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or
      FAFSA Submission Summary (see Chapter 1 of the
      Application and Verification Guide for information on
      the ISIR and FAFSA Submission Summary). This
      requirement ensures that student eligibility data matches are
      conducted to verify that the dependent student on
      whose behalf the parent is borrowing:
      - Is not in default on a Title IV loan and
      does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV
      grant;
      - Has had their Social Security number verified by
      the Social Security Administration; and
      - Has had their citizenship status confirmed by
      either the Social Security Administration or the
      Department of Homeland Security.
      Note that this requirement is for the student to
      submit a FAFSA form. It is not a requirement
      for the parent borrower to submit a FAFSA
      form in the parent9s name, and it does not
      preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose
      information is not included on the FAFSA form
      (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial=
      parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who must file a FAFSA form for dependent students applying for
          a Direct PLUS Loan?
        answer: The dependent student on whose behalf a parent has applied for a
          Direct PLUS Loan must file a FAFSA form.
      - question: What does filing a FAFSA form ensure for dependent students?
        answer: Filing a FAFSA form ensures that the dependent student's
          eligibility data matches are conducted to verify they are not in
          default on a Title IV loan, have a verified Social Security number,
          and have confirmed citizenship status.
      - question: Is it a requirement for the parent borrower to submit a FAFSA
          form in their own name?
        answer: No, it is not a requirement for the parent borrower to submit a
          FAFSA form in their own name. This does not preclude an otherwise
          eligible parent, whose information may not be included on the FAFSA
          form, from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.
  - context: |-
      Adverse Credit History
      For Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes,
      <charged-off= means a debt that has been
      written off as a loss, but that is still
      subject to collection action. <In collection= means a
      debt that has been placed with a collection
      agency by a creditor or that is subject to
      more intensive efforts by a creditor to
      recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not
      responded satisfactorily to the routine demands of the
      creditor9s billing procedures.
      An applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS
      Loan because they have no credit history. That is,
      the absence of a credit history is not considered
      to be adverse credit.
      There are two means by which a Direct PLUS
      Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can
      still qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan. One option is
      for the applicant to obtain an endorser who
      doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser is
      someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if
      the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent
      borrower, the endorser may not be the dependent
      student for whom the parent is borrowing.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does 'charged-off' mean in the context of Direct PLUS
          Loan eligibility?
        answer: Charged-off means a debt that has been written off as a loss but
          is still subject to collection action.
      - question: Can an applicant with no credit history be denied a Direct
          PLUS Loan?
        answer: No, the absence of a credit history is not considered adverse
          credit and cannot result in loan denial.
      - question: How can a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit
          history still qualify for the loan?
        answer: An applicant can qualify by obtaining an endorser without an
          adverse credit history, who agrees to repay the loan if the borrower
          doesn't.
  - context: |-
      Adverse Credit History
      As an alternative to obtaining an endorser,
      an applicant who has been determined to
      have an adverse credit history may also qualify for a
      Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the
      Department showing that there are extenuating circumstances
      associated with the adverse credit. The Department has
      the final decision on determining whether extenuating
      circumstances exist.
      A borrower who qualifies for a Direct
      PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or
      documenting to the satisfaction of the Department
      that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete
      PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.
      If your school participates in the Direct PLUS
      program but a student9s parent cannot obtain a
      Direct PLUS Loan, the student is allowed to borrow
      additional unsubsidized funds (see <Criteria for
      Dependent Students to Receive Additional Direct
      Unsubsidized Loan Funds= in Chapter 4 of this
      volume).

        answer: Applicants with adverse credit history can submit documentation
          to the Department showing extenuating circumstances associated with
          the adverse credit to qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan.
      - question: Who has the final decision on determining whether extenuating
          circumstances exist for a Direct PLUS Loan?

          endorser?
        answer: A borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan through
          extenuating circumstances or an endorser must complete PLUS Loan
          Credit Counseling.

      Adverse Credit History and Default
      Although a default on a Title IV loan
      will generally appear in a student or parent
      Direct PLUS Loan applicant9s credit record and result in
      the individual being determined to have an
      adverse credit history, being in default on a
      Title IV loan and having an adverse credit history are
      separate eligibility issues. A Direct PLUS Loan
      applicant who is identified through the Department9s
      National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) as being in
      default on a Title IV loan and who has
      also been determined to have an adverse credit history
      (due to the default and/or other adverse credit conditions)
      cannot qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan simply by obtaining
      an endorser or by providing acceptable
      documentation of extenuating circumstances. The applicant
      must also separately resolve the default status by one
      of the means discussed under <Resolving Default
      Status= in Volume 1, Chapter 3.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant
          has a default on a Title IV loan?
        answer: A default on a Title IV loan will appear in the applicant's
          credit record and result in them being determined to have an adverse
          credit history.
      - question: Can an applicant with a Title IV loan default and adverse
          credit history qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan with an endorser?
        answer: No, an applicant cannot qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan simply by
          obtaining an endorser if they are in default on a Title IV loan and
          have an adverse credit history.
      - question: What must an applicant do if identified as being in default on
