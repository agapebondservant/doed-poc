      We	have	made	the	following	changes	in	Volume	8	for	2025-2026:
      - In	Chapter	3,	we	have	revised	the	discussion	of	loan	periods	to	provide	a	limited	exception	to	the	longstanding requirement	that	the	loan	period	for	a	Direct	Loan	may	not	include	any	terms	in	which	the	borrower	is	ineligible	to receive	Direct	Loan	funds.
      - Also	in	Chapter	3,	we	have	added	a	slightly	revised	and	expanded	version	of	guidance	on	the	treatment	of	Direct Loan	disbursements	made	after	the	date	of	a	borrower9s	death	that	was	previously	in	Volume	4,	Chapter	2	of	the	FSA Handbook	under	the	heading	<Checking	Eligibility	at	the	Time	of	Disbursement.=	Because	this	guidance	is	specific	to Direct	Loans,	we	believe	Volume	8	is	a	more	appropriate	location.
      - In	Chapter	5,	we	have	revised	Example	6	to	reflect	the	limited	exception	to	the	requirement	that	a	loan	period	may not	include	terms	in	which	the	borrower	is	ineligible	(see	Chapter	3	changes	above).
      - In	Chapter	7,	we	have	revised	the	discussion	of	transfer	students	and	abbreviated	loan	periods	to	clarify	that	in	some circumstances	a	transfer	student	may	be	eligible	to	receive	more	Direct	Loan	funds	for	the	program	at	the	new school	than	a	non-transfer	student	would	be	eligible	to	receive	for	that	same	program.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What changes have been made to Chapter 3 in Volume 8 for
          2025-2026 regarding Direct Loans?
        answer: "Two changes were made to Chapter 3: first, a limited exception was
          introduced to the rule that a Direct Loan's loan period cannot include ineligible
          terms for the borrower; second, revised and expanded guidance on treating
          Direct Loan disbursements after a borrower's death was added, previously
          found in Volume 4, Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook."
      - question: How has Example 6 in Chapter 5 of Volume 8 been revised?
        answer: Example 6 in Chapter 5 has been revised to reflect the limited
          exception to the requirement that a loan period may not include terms
          in which the borrower is ineligible, as discussed in the changes to
          Chapter 3.
      - question: What modification has been done to the discussion of transfer
          students and abbreviated loan periods in Chapter 7 of Volume 8?
        answer: The discussion in Chapter 7 was revised to clarify that, under
          certain circumstances, a transfer student may be eligible for more
          Direct Loan funds for a program at a new school than a non-transfer
          student would be for the same program.

      Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans
      Only	students	who	have	financial	need	may	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans.	The	federal	government	does	not	charge interest	on	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	while	the	borrower	is	enrolled	on	at	least	a	half-time	basis,	during	the	grace	and deferment	periods,	and	during	certain	other	periods	(for	example,	during	certain	periods	of	repayment	under	certain repayment	plans	that	determine	the	required	monthly	payment	amount	based	on	the	borrower9s	income	and	family	size).
      If	a	student	has	received	a	determination	of	need	for	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	in	an	amount	of	$200	or	less,	a	school	may choose	not	to	originate	a	Direct	Subsidized	Loan	and	may	instead	include	that	amount	as	part	of	a	Direct	Unsubsidized Loan.
      Financial	need	is	not	an	eligibility	requirement	to	receive	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan.	The	federal	government	generally charges	interest	on	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans	during	all	periods,	with	limited	exceptions	(for	example,	during	periods	of deferment	for	cancer	treatment).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who is eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans?
        answer: Only students who have demonstrated financial need are eligible
          to receive Direct Subsidized Loans.
      - question: What are the interest conditions for Direct Subsidized Loans?
        answer: The federal government does not charge interest on Direct
          Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time,
          during grace and deferment periods, and certain other periods based on
          income and family size.
      - question: Can a student with a Direct Subsidized Loan amount of $200 or
          less receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan instead?
        answer: Yes, if a student's Direct Subsidized Loan amount is $200 or
          less, the school may choose not to originate the Direct Subsidized
          Loan and instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized
          Loan.

        answer: An undergraduate student attending a school that participates in
          the Federal Pell Grant Program must first receive a determination of
          their Pell Grant eligibility for the period of enrollment for which

      - question: Can minors receive Direct Loans?
        answer: Yes, students who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they
          cannot refuse to repay the loans based on a defense of infancy.
      - question: Is there a requirement for schools to offer both Direct
          Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans?
        answer: Yes, according to the Higher Education Act (HEA) Sec.

      Direct	Subsidized	Loans	and	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loans
      If	you	verify	that	the	parents	of	a	dependent	undergraduate	student	have	refused	to	complete	the	parental	information sections	of	the	Free	Application	for	Federal	Student	Aid	(FAFSA)	form	or	that	they	have	ended	financial	support	for	the student,	you	may	make	a	professional	judgment	decision	to	offer	the	student	a	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	in	an	amount	up to	the	applicable	annual	loan	limit	for	a	dependent	undergraduate.	For	instance,	under	these	circumstances	a	dependent second-year	undergraduate	could	receive	up	to	$6,500	in	Direct	Unsubsidized	Loan	funds	(see	Chapter	4	of	this	volume for	information	on	annual	loan	limits).	However,	the	student	may	not	receive	Direct	Subsidized	Loans	or	aid	from	any	of the	other	Title	IV	programs.
      Self-certification	from	the	dependent	student	is	not	sufficient	to	verify	that	the	parents	have	ended	financial	support	or have	refused	to	complete	the	FAFSA	form.	In	most	cases,	this	requirement	can	be	met	by	obtaining	a	signed	and	dated statement	from	one	of	the	student9s	parents.	For	more	information,	see	the	discussion	under	<Dependent	students without	parent	support=	in	the	<Professional	Judgment=	section	of	Chapter	5	of	the	Application	and	Verification	Guide.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Under what conditions can a dependent undergraduate student
          receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan?
        answer: A dependent undergraduate student can receive a Direct
          Unsubsidized Loan if their parents refuse to complete the parental
          information sections of the FAFSA or end financial support for the
          student.
      - question: What is the maximum Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount a
          dependent second-year undergraduate can receive?
        answer: A dependent second-year undergraduate can receive up to $6,500
          in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds annually.
      - question: How can a professional judgment decision be made regarding
          parental financial support for a dependent student?
        answer: A professional judgment decision can be made by obtaining a
          signed and dated statement from one of the student's parents, as
          self-certification from the dependent student is insufficient.

      Definition	of	<Parent=	for	Direct	PLUS	Loan	Purposes
      If	they	meet	all	other	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility	requirements,	the	following	individuals	can	borrow	Direct	PLUS	Loans	on behalf	of	a	dependent	undergraduate	student:
      - The	student9s	biological	parent;

      - The	student9s	stepparent	(spouse	of	the	student9s	biological	or	legal	adoptive	parent	at	the	time	of	application),	but only	if	the	stepparent	is	required	to	provide	their	information	on	the	FAFSA	form	in	accordance	with	the	instructions on	the	FAFSA	form.
      Grandparents	and	other	family	members	are	not	eligible	to	take	out	Direct	PLUS	Loans	on	behalf	of	a	dependent undergraduate	student	unless	they	have	legally	adopted	the	student.
      In	addition	to	the	parent(s)	whose	resources	are	reported	on	a	student9s	FAFSA	form,	any	otherwise	eligible	biological	or legal	adoptive	parent	of	the	dependent	undergraduate	student	can	also	take	out	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	on	the	student9s behalf,	even	if	that	parent9s	information	is	not	reported	on	the	FAFSA	form.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Who can borrow Direct PLUS Loans on behalf of a dependent
          undergraduate student?
        answer: The student's biological parent, legal adoptive parent, or
          stepparent (spouse of the student's biological or legal adoptive
          parent at the time of application) can borrow Direct PLUS Loans,
          provided the stepparent is required to provide information on the
          FAFSA form.
      - question: Can grandparents or other family members borrow Direct PLUS
          Loans for a dependent undergraduate student?
        answer: No, grandparents and other family members cannot borrow Direct
          PLUS Loans for a dependent undergraduate student unless they have
          legally adopted the student.
      - question: Can a parent not reported on the FAFSA form still take out a
          Direct PLUS Loan for a dependent undergraduate student?
        answer: Yes, any otherwise eligible biological or legal adoptive parent
          of the dependent undergraduate student can take out a Direct PLUS
          Loan, even if their information is not reported on the FAFSA form.

      Requirement	for	Dependent	Students	To	File	a	FAFSA	Form
      In	all	cases,	the	dependent	student	on	whose	behalf	a	parent	has	applied	for	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	must	have	filed	a	FAFSA form	and	received	an	Institutional	Student	Information	Record	(ISIR)	or	FAFSA	Submission	Summary	(see	Chapter	1	of	the Application	and	Verification	Guide	for	information	on	the	ISIR	and	FAFSA	Submission	Summary).	This	requirement	ensures that	student	eligibility	data	matches	are	conducted	to	verify	that	the	dependent	student	on	whose	behalf	the	parent	is borrowing:
      - Is	not	in	default	on	a	Title	IV	loan	and	does	not	owe	an	overpayment	on	a	Title	IV	grant;
      - Has	had	their	Social	Security	number	verified	by	the	Social	Security	Administration;	and
      - Has	had	their	citizenship	status	confirmed	by	either	the	Social	Security	Administration	or	the	Department	of Homeland	Security.
      Note	that	this	requirement	is	for	the student to	submit	a	FAFSA	form.	It	is	not	a	requirement	for	the	parent	borrower	to submit	a	FAFSA	form	in	the	parent9s	name,	and	it	does	not	preclude	an	otherwise	eligible	parent	whose	information	is	not included	on	the	FAFSA	form	(sometimes	referred	to	as	a	<non-custodial=	parent)	from	obtaining	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is required of a dependent student for a parent to apply
          for a Direct PLUS Loan?
        answer: The dependent student must have filed a FAFSA form and received
          an Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or FAFSA Submission
          Summary.
      - question: What does the dependent student's eligibility verification
          ensure in the context of a Direct PLUS Loan?
        answer: It ensures the student is not in default on a Title IV loan, has
          a verified Social Security number, and has confirmed citizenship
          status.
      - question: Is it necessary for the parent borrower to submit a FAFSA form
          in their own name to secure a Direct PLUS Loan for a dependent
          student?
        answer: No, it is not required for the parent borrower to submit a FAFSA
          form in their own name; the dependent student's FAFSA submission is
          sufficient.

      Adverse	Credit	History
      For	Direct	PLUS	Loan	eligibility	purposes,	<charged-off=	means	a	debt	that	has	been	written	off	as	a	loss,	but	that	is	still subject	to	collection	action.	<In	collection=	means	a	debt	that	has	been	placed	with	a	collection	agency	by	a	creditor	or that	is	subject	to	more	intensive	efforts	by	a	creditor	to	recover	amounts	owed	from	a	borrower	who	has	not	responded satisfactorily	to	the	routine	demands	of	the	creditor9s	billing	procedures.
      An	applicant	cannot	be	denied	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	because	they	have	no	credit	history.	That	is,	the	absence	of	a	credit history	is	not	considered	to	be	adverse	credit.
      There	are	two	means	by	which	a	Direct	PLUS	Loan	applicant	with	an	adverse	credit	history	can	still	qualify	for	a	Direct PLUS	Loan.	One	option	is	for	the	applicant	to	obtain	an	endorser	who	doesn9t	have	an	adverse	credit	history.	An	endorser is	someone	who	agrees	to	repay	the	Direct	PLUS	Loan	if	the	borrower	doesn9t	repay	it.	For	a	parent	borrower,	the endorser	may	not	be	the	dependent	student	for	whom	the	parent	is	borrowing.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does 'charged-off' mean in the context of Direct PLUS
          Loan eligibility?
        answer: Charged-off means a debt that has been written off as a loss but
          is still subject to collection action.
      - question: Can an applicant be denied a Direct PLUS Loan due to lack of
          credit history?
        answer: No, an applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because
          they have no credit history; it is not considered adverse credit.
      - question: How can a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit
          history still qualify for the loan?
        answer: An applicant with adverse credit history can still qualify by
          obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history,
          agreeing to repay the loan if the borrower doesn't.

      - question: What happens if a student or parent Direct PLUS Loan applicant
          has a default on a Title IV loan?
        answer: A default on a Title IV loan will appear in the applicant's
