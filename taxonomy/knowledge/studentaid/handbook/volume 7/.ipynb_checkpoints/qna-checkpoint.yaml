      34 CFR 668.2
      A student enrolled in a program that lasts
      longer than five years, typically first professional
      degree programs such as a six-year pharmacy
      program, can be considered an undergraduate for
      only the first three or four years. Students
      enrolled in dual-degree programs that confer a
      bachelor9s degree and either a graduate or
      first professional degree are undergraduates for at
      least the first three years of the program. The
      school determines at what point after three years the
      student ceases to be an undergraduate student.
      The student must be considered a graduate
      student after the fourth year of such programs (see
      Volume 1, Chapter 1 for further discussion).
      Occasionally, a student will complete all the
      requirements for a bachelor9s degree but will
      continue taking undergraduate courses without accepting the
      degree. Your school must decide whether and at what
      point the student completed the baccalaureate course of
      study. If your school determines that the student did
      complete a bachelor9s program (regardless of whether the
      student accepted the degree), then the student is
      no longer eligible to receive a Pell Grant.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Can a student enrolled in a program longer than five years,
          like a six-year pharmacy program, be considered an undergraduate
          beyond the first three or four years?
        answer: No, such students are considered undergraduates only for the
          first three or four years. Afterward, they must be considered graduate
          students.
      - question: What is the status of students enrolled in dual-degree
          programs that confer both a bachelor's degree and a graduate or first
          professional degree?
        answer: These students are considered undergraduates for at least the
          first three years, with the school determining when they cease to be
          undergraduates.
      - question: What happens if a student completes all bachelor's degree
          requirements but continues taking undergraduate courses without
          accepting the degree?
        answer: The school must decide when the student completed the
          baccalaureate course of study. If the school determines completion,
          the student becomes ineligible for a Pell Grant.

      Wrong Grade Level on the FAFSA Form
      When an undergraduate student incorrectly reports on the
      Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA Â® )
      form that the student will be a graduate
      student or has a bachelor9s degree, the student
      must correct that information. Because the application shows
      that the student isn9t an undergraduate, the
      Department9s records will show that the student is
      ineligible for Pell. If the application isn9t
      corrected, the school won9t be able to pay the
      student a Pell Grant.
      Eligible Postbaccalaureate Program
      A student who is enrolled at least half
      time in a postbaccalaureate teacher certification or
      licensure program is eligible to receive a
      Pell Grant for the period necessary to complete
      the program if:
      - The program does not lead to a graduate
      degree;
      - The school offering the program does not also
      offer a bachelor9s degree in education;
      - The student is pursuing an initial teacher
      certification or licensing credential within a
      state; and
      - The program consists of the courses required by
      a state to receive a professional certification or
      licensing credential necessary for employment as a
      teacher in an elementary or secondary school in
      that state.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What happens if an undergraduate student incorrectly reports
          their status on the FAFSA form?
        answer: If an undergraduate student incorrectly reports their status as
          a graduate student or having a bachelor's degree, they must correct
          the information. Failure to do so will make the student ineligible for
          a Pell Grant, and the school won't be able to pay the student a Pell
          Grant.
      - question: Can a student enrolled in a postbaccalaureate teacher
          certification or licensure program receive a Pell Grant?
        answer: Yes, a student enrolled at least half-time in a
          postbaccalaureate teacher certification or licensure program can
          receive a Pell Grant for the duration of the program, provided the
          program does not lead to a graduate degree, the school doesn't offer a
          bachelor's degree in education, the student is pursuing initial
          teacher certification or licensing within a state, and the program
          consists of courses required by a state for professional certification
          or licensing necessary for teacher employment in elementary or
          secondary schools.
      - question: What are the conditions for a postbaccalaureate program to
          make a student eligible for a Pell Grant?
        answer: A postbaccalaureate program must not lead to a graduate degree,
          not offer a bachelor's degree in education, be pursued for initial
          teacher certification or licensing within a state, and consist of
          courses required by a state for professional certification or
          licensing necessary for teacher employment in elementary or secondary
          schools to make a student eligible for a Pell Grant.

      Wrong Grade Level on the FAFSA Form
      Under this very limited provision , a postbaccalaureate
      program is defined as a program that generally
      requires a student to have a bachelor9s
      degree before being admitted to the program.
      Accordingly, a program in which undergraduate students
      are routinely allowed to enroll would not meet the
      definition of a postbaccalaureate program for this
      purpose, nor would a program that is generally
      open to undergraduates but that also admits students
      with bachelor9s degrees. For Title IV purposes, a
      school must treat a student who receives a
      Pell Grant under this provision as enrolled in
      an undergraduate program. Such a student is
      eligible for Federal Work-Study and fifth-year
      undergraduate (not graduate student) Direct Loan limits but
      would not be eligible for a Federal
      Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is a postbaccalaureate program defined as according to
          the limited provision mentioned?
        answer: A postbaccalaureate program is defined as a program that
          generally requires a student to have a bachelor's degree before being
          admitted.
      - question: Can undergraduate students routinely enroll in a
          postbaccalaureate program for Title IV purposes?
        answer: No, undergraduate students cannot routinely enroll in a
          postbaccalaureate program for Title IV purposes; such a student is
          treated as enrolled in an undergraduate program.
      - question: What loan limits and aid is a student eligible for if they
          receive a Pell Grant under this provision?
        answer: A student receiving a Pell Grant under this provision is
          eligible for Federal Work-Study and fifth-year undergraduate Direct
          Loan limits but not for a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity
          Grant (FSEOG).
  - context: |-
      Eligible Postbaccalaureate Program and the FAFSA
      Normally, students who indicate on the
      FAFSA that they have a bachelor9s degree won9t be
      listed in the Department9s records as Pell-eligible
      students, and the school won9t be able to
      receive Pell funds for them. However, to allow
      students who are eligible under the postbaccalaureate
      program provision to be paid, students who
      correctly report that they have a bachelor9s degree but
      also indicate on the FAFSA form that they are
      in a teaching credential program will be
      listed as Pelleligible students. Of course, you
      must determine whether the student falls under the
      eligible postbaccalaureate provision.
      Prohibition on Receiving Two Pell Grant Payments
      for Concurrent Enrollment
      A student may not receive Pell Grant payments
      concurrently from more than one school. If a
      student is awarded Pell for any period of concurrent
      enrollment, the student has the choice of which
      award to receive but is limited to a single
      award from a single school.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Can students with a bachelor's degree still be eligible for
          Pell Grants?
        answer: Yes, students who correctly report having a bachelor's degree
          but are also enrolled in a teaching credential program can be listed
          as Pell-eligible under the postbaccalaureate program provision.
      - question: Is it possible for a student to receive Pell Grant payments
          from multiple schools simultaneously?
        answer: No, a student cannot receive Pell Grant payments concurrently
          from more than one school. If awarded for concurrent enrollment, the
          student must choose only one award from a single school.
      - question: What factors determine if a student falls under the eligible
          postbaccalaureate provision for Pell Grants?
        answer: A student must have a bachelor's degree and be enrolled in a
          teaching credential program to be considered under the eligible
          postbaccalaureate provision for Pell Grants.
  - context: |-
      Eligible Postbaccalaureate Program and the FAFSA
      For Pell purposes, the phrase <concurrently
      from more than one institution= means that the
      student must be attending both schools at the same
      time for the concurrent Pell Grant prohibition to
      apply. A student who withdraws from one school and
      enrolls at least one day later in another school is
      normally not considered to have been enrolled
      concurrently. If a Pell-eligible student withdraws from one
      institution but meets one of the Return of
      Title IV Funds (R2T4) withdrawal exemptions and
      subsequently enrolls at a different institution
      during the same payment period, the new institution can
      award Pell Grant funds for any remaining portion
      of the overlapping payment period. See Chapter 6 of
      this volume for additional information on awarding
      remaining eligibility for a transfer student.
      The new institution should maintain documentation in the
      student9s file supporting a Pell Grant
      disbursement at that institution following the
      student's withdrawal from the prior school.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does 'concurrently from more than one institution' mean
          in the context of Pell Grant eligibility?
        answer: It means a student must be attending both schools simultaneously
          for the concurrent Pell Grant prohibition to apply.
      - question: What happens if a Pell-eligible student withdraws from one
          institution and enrolls in another during the same payment period?
        answer: The new institution can award Pell Grant funds for any remaining
          portion of the overlapping payment period, provided the student meets
          certain withdrawal exemptions.
      - question: What documentation should the new institution maintain
          regarding Pell Grant disbursement for a transfer student?
        answer: The new institution should keep records in the student's file
          supporting a Pell Grant disbursement at that institution following the
          student's withdrawal from the prior school.

      Cost of Attendance for Incarcerated Students
      The cost of attendance for students who are
      incarcerated may include the following: tuition,
      fees, books, course materials, supplies, equipment, and the
      cost of obtaining a license, certification, or
      a first professional credential. For more information
      on the cost of attendance, see Volume 3,
      Chapter 2 of the FSA Handbook.
      Confined or incarcerated individuals may not
      receive Pell Grant funds for more than their cost of
      attendance and may not receive a Title IV
      credit balance. To ensure that all allowable
      costs are included in the cost of the
      attendance, schools must include books, course materials,
      equipment, and supplies as part of
      institutional charges and either provide those materials directly
      to the individual or include the costs of
      books and supplies in the individual9s tuition and
      fees. If a credit balance is created, the
      school must return the Pell Grant funds associated
      with the credit balance to the Department and it
      will be credited to the student's remaining
      Pell eligibility.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What expenses are typically included in the cost of attendance
          for incarcerated students?
        answer: The cost of attendance for incarcerated students includes
          tuition, fees, books, course materials, supplies, equipment, and the
          cost of obtaining a license, certification, or a first professional
          credential.
      - question: Can incarcerated individuals receive Pell Grant funds
          exceeding their cost of attendance?
        answer: No, incarcerated individuals cannot receive Pell Grant funds
          exceeding their cost of attendance and are not eligible for a Title IV
          credit balance.
      - question: What are the regulations regarding credit balances for
          confined or incarcerated individuals under Pell Grant?
        answer: According to 34 CFR 668, Subpart P, prison education programs
          have specific requirements, and 34 CFR 690.62(b)(1) prohibits the
          issuance of credit balances for confined or incarcerated individuals.
