      Introduction
      This volume of the Federal Student Aid (FSA) Handbook
      discusses the academic calendar, payment period, and
      disbursement requirements for awarding aid under
      the Title IV student financial aid programs,
      determining a student9s cost of attendance, and
      packaging Title IV aid.
      Throughout this volume of the Handbook, the
      words "we," "our," and "us" refer to the United
      States Department of Education (the Department). The
      word "you" refers to the primary audience of the
      Handbook, school financial aid administrators. In
      other volumes of the Handbook we use
      "institution," "school," and "college" interchangeably,
      unless a more specific meaning is provided. In
      this volume we consistently use the term "school."
      <HEA= refers to the Higher Education Act of
      1965, as amended. Title IV refers to the
      student financial aid programs authorized under
      Title IV of the HEA.

      Chapter 2
      - We have revised the discussion of <Allowable
      Costs= to clarify that for Pell Grant recipients
      with an enrollment intensity below 50%, the cost of
      attendance (COA) is still based on the full-year
      costs for a full-time student. In this same
      section, we have also removed text noting that the
      FAFSA Simplification Act made certain changes to COA
      components. These changes are no longer new and were
      previously incorporated into the 2023-2024 FSA
      Handbook.
      - Under <Tuition and Fees,= we have added health
      insurance premiums that are charged to all
      students as an additional example of a cost
      that may be included in this COA component.
      - We have revised the text under <Costs of
      Obtaining a License, Certification, or First
      Professional Credential= to clarify that the guidance
      in this section pertains to credentials that are
      required for a student to practice or
      participate in the occupation the program is preparing
      the student to enter, and have added bar exam
      fees as an example of one of the types of
      costs that may be included in this COA
      component.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How does the revised discussion clarify allowable costs for
          Pell Grant recipients with an enrollment intensity below 50%?
        answer: The revised discussion clarifies that for Pell Grant recipients
          with an enrollment intensity below 50%, the cost of attendance (COA)
          remains based on the full-year costs for a full-time student.
      - question: What additional cost has been included under Tuition and Fees
          in the revised text?
        answer: Health insurance premiums charged to all students have been
          added as an additional example of a cost that may be included in the
          Tuition and Fees COA component.
      - question: What has been revised in the guidance for Costs of Obtaining a
          License, Certification, or First Professional Credential section?
        answer: The revised text clarifies that the guidance pertains to
          credentials required for a student to practice or participate in the
          occupation the program prepares them for, and bar exam fees have been
          added as an example of costs that may be included in this COA
          component.

      Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic
      Year
      For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the
      law and regulations require an academic year to
      include a minimum number of weeks of instructional
      time.
      - For a program offered in credit hours , the academic
      year must include at least 30 weeks of
      instructional time.
      - For a program offered in clock hours , the academic
      year must include at least 26 weeks of
      instructional time.
      Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information
      about academic year requirements for direct assessment
      programs, which do not measure academic progress
      using credit or clock hours.
      The number of weeks of instructional time is
      based on the period that generally begins on the
      first day of classes in the academic year and
      ends on the last day of classes or the
      last day of examinations, whichever is later.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the minimum number of weeks of instructional time
          required for an undergraduate or graduate program offered in credit
          hours?
        answer: The academic year must include at least 30 weeks of
          instructional time.
      - question: For a program offered in clock hours, how many weeks of
          instructional time are mandated in an academic year?
        answer: The academic year must include at least 26 weeks of
          instructional time.
      - question: When does the period for counting instructional weeks in an
          academic year begin and end?
        answer: This period generally begins on the first day of classes and
          ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations,
          whichever is later.

      Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic
      Year
      Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or
      baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the
      Department if they want to request approval to
      establish a full academic year of less
      than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department
      is permitted to grant a reduction for good
      cause to no less than 26 weeks of
      instructional time. These requests are handled on a
      case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the
      School Participation Division that oversees your
      school. A listing of contact information for the
      regional School Participation Divisions can be
      found in the Knowledge Center.
      For all Title IV programs, a week of
      instructional time is any period of seven consecutive
      days in which 3
      - At least one day of regularly scheduled
      instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the
      last scheduled day of classes
      for a term or payment period, at least one
      scheduled day of study for examinations occurs;
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the minimum instructional time required for schools to
          apply for a reduced academic year?
        answer: Schools must provide at least 26 weeks of instructional time to
          request approval for a reduced academic year, which is less than 30
          weeks.
      - question: Who handles requests for a reduced academic year, and where
          can contact information be found?
        answer: Requests are handled by the School Participation Division
          overseeing the school, and their contact information can be found in
          the Knowledge Center.
      - question: How is a week of instructional time defined for Title IV
          programs?
        answer: A week of instructional time consists of any seven consecutive
          days with at least one day of regular instruction or examinations, or
          one scheduled day for examinations after the last class day of a term
          or payment period.
  - context: |-
      or
      Instructional time excludes scheduled breaks and
      activities that aren't included in the definition
      of "academic engagement" (see Volume 5, Chapter 2 3
      Part 1 for more information) or periods of
      orientation or counseling. Therefore, the weeks of
      instructional time may be less than the number of
      calendar weeks that elapse between the first day of
      classes and the last day of classes or
      examinations. Note that the Department has not set
      a regulatory standard for the number of
      hours of instructional time that make up one day
      of instruction. This has been left to the
      reasonable interpretation of schools and their accrediting
      agencies.
      Although most programs are at least one
      academic year in length, some eligible programs
      are shorter than an academic year. See Volume 2,
      Chapter 2 for more detail on the requirements for
      such programs.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What does instructional time exclude according to the
          paragraph?
        answer: Instructional time excludes scheduled breaks and activities not
          considered 'academic engagement', as well as orientation or counseling
          periods.
      - question: Can the weeks of instructional time match the calendar weeks
          between the first and last day of classes or exams? Why?
        answer: No, instructional time weeks may be less than calendar weeks due
          to exclusions like breaks, non-academic activities, and
          orientation/counseling periods.
      - question: Is there a regulatory standard set for the number of
          instructional time hours per day? If not, who determines it?
        answer: No regulatory standard exists for instructional time hours per
          day; it's left to the reasonable interpretation of schools and their
          accrediting agencies.
  - context: |-
      Weeks of instructional time:
      - Cannot overlap, and a school cannot use a
      single day of scheduled instruction, exams, or
      study time to create more than one week of
      instruction (for example, a school may not end
      a week of instructional time on one day and
      begin the next week of instructional time on the
      same day);
      - May begin and end on a day other than
      Monday, provided that each week of instructional
      time comprises seven consecutive days (for example,
      a Wednesday through the following Tuesday)
      that include at least one day of scheduled
      instruction, exams, or study time, as required by
      the regulations; and
      - May begin up to six days before the first day
      of scheduled instruction or exams in a
      payment period.
      Note: All references to <weeks= in the
      examples that appear throughout this chapter mean
      weeks of instructional time as defined above.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Can a school use the same day for the end of one week of
          instructional time and the beginning of the next week?
        answer: No, a school cannot use a single day of scheduled instruction,
          exams, or study time to create more than one week of instructional
          time, meaning no overlapping or back-to-back weeks on the same day.
      - question: On which day can a week of instructional time begin and end,
          according to the regulations?
        answer: A week of instructional time may begin and end on any day other
          than Monday, as long as it comprises seven consecutive days including
          at least one day of scheduled instruction, exams, or study time.
      - question: How early in a payment period can a week of instructional time
          commence?
        answer: A week of instructional time may begin up to six days before the
          first day of scheduled instruction or exams in a payment period.

      Academic Year Definition and Effect on Awards
      The Title IV academic year that a school
      defines for a program must meet the regulatory
      minimums for both clock or credit hours and weeks of
      instructional time, as described above. In some
      instances, the defined academic year for a program
      may not coincide with the academic calendar
      of the school. For example, a school might
      define the academic year for a program as containing
      24 semester hours and 30 weeks of
      instructional time but have an academic calendar
      consisting of four 8-week nonstandard terms (i.e., 32
      weeks of instructional time). This would affect the
      calculation of Pell Grant awards, as explained in
      Volume 7.
      As discussed later in this chapter and in
      Volume 8, Chapter 6, the timing of disbursements
      and, for the Direct Loan Program, annual loan limit
      progression will be affected if a program is
      an academic year in length in credit or
      clock hours but not in weeks of instructional
      time, or for a program longer than an academic
      year in length, if a student9s completion of the
      credit or clock hours in the program9s academic
      year does not coincide with completion of the
      weeks of instructional time in the academic
      year.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the regulatory minimums for clock or credit hours and
          weeks of instructional time in a Title IV academic year?
        answer: The regulatory minimums for a Title IV academic year include a
          minimum number of clock or credit hours (not specified) and a minimum
          of 30 weeks of instructional time, as described above.
      - question: How can a school's defined academic year for a program differ
          from its academic calendar?
        answer: A school's defined academic year for a program may not align
          with its academic calendar, for instance, having an academic year
          consisting of nonstandard terms that result in more or fewer weeks of
          instructional time than the defined minimum.
      - question: What impact can discrepancies between credit/clock hours and
          weeks of instructional time have on financial aid programs like Pell
          Grants and Direct Loans?
        answer: Discrepancies between credit/clock hours and weeks of
          instructional time can affect the calculation of Pell Grant awards and
          the timing of disbursements for the Direct Loan Program, especially if
          a program's length in credit or clock hours does not correspond with
          the weeks of instructional time in the academic year.

      Academic Calendars and Terms
      Schools offer programs with many kinds of academic
      calendars that differ from the traditional fall-spring
      school year. For the Title IV programs, academic
      calendars may be one of the following
      types:
      - standard term,
      - nonstandard term,
      - non-term (includes clock-hour calendars), or
      - subscription-based.
      In a standard term or nonstandard term academic
      calendar , a term is generally a period in
      which all classes are scheduled to begin and end
      within a set time frame, and academic progress
      is measured in credit hours.
      In a non-term academic calendar , classes do not
      begin and end within a set time frame, such as
      a term. Academic progress in a non-term
      program can be measured in either credit or
      clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a
      program with terms must be treated as a non-
      term program for Title IV purposes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the different types of academic calendars for Title
          IV programs?
        answer: The different types of academic calendars for Title IV programs
          are standard term, nonstandard term, non-term (including clock-hour
          calendars), and subscription-based.
      - question: How is academic progress measured in a standard term or
          nonstandard term calendar?
        answer: In a standard term or nonstandard term calendar, academic
          progress is measured in credit hours.
      - question: Can you explain the nature of classes in a non-term academic
          calendar?
        answer: In a non-term academic calendar, classes do not adhere to a set
          time frame, and academic progress can be measured in either credit or
          clock hours.
