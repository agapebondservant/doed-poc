      What is a Georgia scholarship?
      A Georgia scholarship is an award given to a student who is either from Georgia or is attending college in Georgia. Like all types of scholarships, Georgia scholarships do not have to be paid back after you graduate or leave school.
      Georgia scholarships may be either merit- or need-based, depending on the particular scholarship and its funding organization. Some scholarships may not look at the student's finances at all, while others will consider both grades and financial need.
      For example, the Greenhouse Scholars Whole Person Scholarship requires that students have a 3.5 GPA or higher and also that their family earns less than $80,000 per year. Students must also be from Georgia, California, Colorado, Illinois, New York or North
      Carolina. Only high school seniors are eligible to apply, and they must attend a four-year school. The scholarship is worth $5,000 per year for four years total.
      Some Georgia scholarships will cover the entire cost of tuition. However, most will only cover a portion of costs. If you apply to several different scholarships, you may be able to significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.
    questions_and_answers:

      Where to find Georgia scholarships
      There are many different places where you can find Georgia scholarships. Many Georgia scholarships come directly from the school you plan to attend, especially if you're attending school in-state. Most state schools have a special list of scholarships for local students to encourage them to stay.
      Like with other scholarships, you can also search Google for 'Georgia scholarships.' If you go this route, try narrowing your search beyond just general state scholarships. For example, if you're from Decatur, Georgia, look for 'Decatur Georgia scholarships.' This will result in a smaller list of scholarships that you might be better qualified for, potentially maximizing your chances of winning an award.
      You can find Georgia scholarships through major sites, like Scholarships.com, which has a robust awards directory. If you sign up for an account, you will be notified when a new scholarship is posted that you're a good candidate for.
      Scholarships can come from either nonprofit or for-profit companies. Local organizations often provide local scholarships to area students. For example, the GLA Hubbard Scholarship is sponsored by the Georgia Library Association. This one-time $3,000 award is given to a student who is a resident of Georgia studying Library Sciences.

      How to apply for Georgia scholarships
      One of the first steps is to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Most students think that the FAFSA is only necessary if they want to apply for federal student loans, but many scholarship applications also require the FAFSA. If you fill out the FAFSA, you are not required to take out federal student loans.
      Another bonus? If you submit the FAFSA, you'll also be in the running for federal grants like the Pell Grant. There's no reason not to submit the FAFSA, unless you're not eligible to do so.
      Students should also complete the Georgia State Financial Application (GSFAPP). The GSFAPP gives you access to a variety of different scholarships, including the HOPE and Zell Miller awards. These are significant state-based scholarships that can help students who are attending school within the state.
      Scholarships from third-party organizations and companies often have their own application, but may also require the FAFSA or the GSFAPP. When applying for a scholarship or grant, make sure you understand which documents are required.
