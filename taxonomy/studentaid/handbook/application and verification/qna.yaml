    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) and what 
          does it do?
        answer: The FA-DDX is a direct data exchange authorized by the FUTURE 
          Act between the Department of Education and the Internal Revenue 
          Service (IRS) to facilitate completing the FAFSA form. It eliminates 
          the need for most applicants to self-report income and tax 
          information, as federal tax information is transferred directly and 
          considered verified for Title IV purposes.
      - question: How does the FA-DDX differ from the IRS Data Retrieval Tool 
          (DRT) in terms of consent?
        answer: Unlike the IRS-DRT, which allowed applicants to opt-in, the 
          FA-DDX requires applicants and contributors (student's spouse and/or 
          parents) to provide explicit consent and approval for the Department 
          to obtain federal tax information from the IRS via the FA-DDX and use 
          it to determine the student's eligibility for federal student aid.
      - question: When was the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) retired and what 
          replaced it?
        answer: The IRS Data Retrieval Tool (DRT) was retired after the close of
          the 2023-24 application cycle. It was replaced by the FUTURE Act 
          Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX), which provides a direct data exchange 
          between the Department of Education and the IRS to facilitate FAFSA 
          completion.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What changes were made to the FAFSA guide regarding student 
          tax filing status?
        answer: The FAFSA guide now includes subsections on nontax filers, 
          foreign countries and international organizations, and fiscal year tax
          returns under the Student Tax Filing Status section.
      - question: How has the tax line number for education credits been updated
          in the FAFSA guide?
        answer: 'The tax line number for education credits has been updated to IRS
          Form 1040: line 29 + IRS Form 1040 Schedule 3: line 3.'
      - question: What modifications were implemented for the Parent Tax Filing 
          Status section in the FAFSA guide?
        answer: The Parent Tax Filing Status section has been expanded to 
          explain the six answer options on the FAFSA form and when each should 
          be selected, as well as addressing conflicting information that 
          requires resolution (comment code 303).

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What changes were made to the Verification of Identity 
          functionality in the FPP?
        answer: A note was added regarding the unavailability of the

          the Department provided around reporting timeframes.
      - question: How were negative values treated in calculating Income Earned 
          from Work?
        answer: A note was added to the Using the Tax Return section regarding

          Work.
      - question: What modifications were done to the Special Cases section and 
          the exception for certain amended tax return filers?
        answer: The Special Cases section was renamed to Unique Situations and 
          Exceptions, and Verification for Confined or Incarcerated Individuals 
          was moved to a subsection under this. The exception to not update tax 
          information for certain amended tax return filers was removed, as it 
          was limited to the 2024-25 application cycle.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the form required by law for applying for Federal 
          Student Aid (FSA) programs, and who provides it?
        answer: The form is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA 
          ® ) form, provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED, 
          Department).
      - question: What information does the FAFSA form collect, and how is it 
          used?
        answer: The FAFSA form collects financial and other information to 
          calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI) and determine a student's 
          eligibility for federal student aid.
      - question: Can a school require additional information beyond the FAFSA 
          for Title IV aid, and if so, under what circumstances?
        answer: A school may not generally require extra information for Title 
          IV aid, except for verification, resolving conflicting information, or
          professional judgment determinations. However, additional information 
          for other purposes, like private or institutional aid, can be 
          collected, and if it affects Title IV eligibility, the school must 
          consider it when awarding aid.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is required to create a StudentAid.gov account for the

          knowledge-based identity verification process.
